If the Imbalance is a result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt being lower than the delivered quantity ofGas for Customer’s account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a “Negative Imbalance”.

(i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume fromCustomer is 7% less than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall theCash-Out Price be increased more than 10%; and 2.For Positive Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be decreased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentagepoint, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume fromCustomer is 7% greater than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shallthe Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%.Article V. CurtailmentIf the quantity of Customer Gas and all other Gas available for delivery into the Transportation System exceeds the capacity of theTransportation System at any point, then Transporter shall interrupt or curtail receipts of Customer Gas with respect to the affected point(s) only inaccordance with the following:(a) First, Transporter shall curtail all Interruptible Service Gas prior to curtailing Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some,but not all, Interruptible Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System available forInterruptible Service Gas at the affected points on a pro rata basis based upon Customer’s last confirmed nomination of Interruptible Service Gashereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Interruptible Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the eventcausing the curtailment.(b) Second, if additional curtailments are required beyond those described in the immediately preceding clause (a), Transporter shallcurtail Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Firm Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate thecapacity of the Transportation System at the affected point(s) on a pro rata basis based upon Customer’s last confirmed nomination of Firm ServiceGas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Firm Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the eventcausing the curtailment.Transporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as isreasonable under the circumstances.Article VI.
