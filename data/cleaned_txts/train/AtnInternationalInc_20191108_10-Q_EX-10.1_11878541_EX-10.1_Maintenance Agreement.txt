The “Proportionate Share” payable by Vendorshall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at ATT’s sole discretion, but rather on anobjectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and usingthe same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law)to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicableProvided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes ATT’s assessment of Vendor’sProportionate Share is not fair and equitable, then Vendor’s Proportionate Share shall be determined,insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failureof the Parties to agree on Vendor’s Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to payits Proportionate Share under this Section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of itsProportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor beliable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannotmutually agree on Vendor’s Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of ATT’s providing Vendorwith ATT’s assessment of Vendor’s Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that adispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth inSection 4.8 (“Dispute Resolution”), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section4.8(a), Vendor shall notify ATT in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith,constitutes Vendor’s Proportionate Share (“Vendor’s Minimum Share”).

When Vendor’s Proportionate Share is finallydetermined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) (“Determined ProportionateShare”), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to ATT the aggregate amount of pastunderpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the DeterminedProportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to ATT), if any. Thereafter,Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (In the event that the DeterminedProportionate Share is less than the Vendor’s Minimum Share, ATT shall refund to Vendor any pastoverpayments.) In no event shall ATT’s acceptance of payments computed at Vendor’s MinimumShare prejudice or waive any of ATT’s rights under this Agreement.Proprietary and ConfidentialThis Agreement and information contained therein is not for use or disclosure outside of ATT, its Affiliates, andthird party representatives, and Vendor except under written agreement by the contracting parties.22Source: ATN INTERNATIONAL, INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2019(iii) ATT shall have sole control over the defense of (1) any Combination Claim and (2) any other CoveredClaim that involves Vendor and one or more other suppliers of ATT or its Affiliates ((1) and (2) beinghereinafter referred to separately and collectively as a “Compound Claim”).

Where ATT controls the defense under thisSubsection (b)(iii), ATT shall make good faith efforts to enter into a reasonable joint defense orcommon interest agreement with Vendor.(iv) Insofar as Vendor’s obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a CoveredClaim other than a Compound Claim, Vendor shall have the discretion, but not the obligation, to controlthe defense of the Covered Claim. In the event that Vendor controls the defense of the Covered Claim,Vendor shall retain as its lead counsel, subject to ATT’s approval (which shall not be withheld,conditioned or delayed except for reasons of apparent or actual conflict of interest), one or morecompetent attorneys from a nationally recognized law firm who have significant experience in litigatingintellectual property claims of the type at issue, and the ATT Indemnified Parties may, at their optionand sole expense, participate with Vendor in the defense of such Covered Claim.(v) ATT shall notify Vendor promptly of any Covered Claim; provided, however, that any delay in suchnotice shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations under this Section, except insofar as Vendor can showthat such delay actually and materially prejudiced Vendor.(vi) In no event shall Vendor settle, without ATT’s prior written consent, any Covered Claim, in whole or inpart, in a manner that would require any ATT Indemnified Party to discontinue or materially modify itsproducts or services (or offerings thereof). In no event shall Vendor enter into any agreement related toany Covered Claim or to the Intellectual Property Rights asserted therein that discharges or mitigatesVendor’s liability to the third-party claimant but fails to fully discharge all of ATT’s liabilities as to theCovered Loss.(c) Continued Use of Provided Elements Upon Injunction.
