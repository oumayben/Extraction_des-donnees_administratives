Suchcredits are available when the services provided for the affected devices are less than the Monthly Availability Percentage.“IBM Managed Device” means a Base Component located in an IBM e-business Hosting Center for which IBM is performingmanagement responsibilities. For servers, only the servers identified as Fully Managed Servers in Exhibit A are considered an IBMManaged Device.“Monthly Availability Percentage” means the amount equal to the total number of minutes in the applicable month minus the QualifyingOutage Minutes for that month, divided by the total number of minutes in that month.“Monthly Recurring Charge” means the total of Customer’s monthly recurring charges.“Outage” means the period (measured in whole minutes) from the time indicated in a trouble ticket (when the Outage was reported toIBM) to the Outage end time based upon the problem resolution (as reflected in the trouble ticket call record). For clustered devices, allof the devices in the cluster must not be available for use by Customer.“Qualifying Server” means the IBM Managed Server that has been selected by Customer and approved by IBM.“Qualifying Outage Minutes” means the aggregate of all Outages in a month, minus any Outages in that month resulting from anyexclusion described in Section 8.6 below.“SLA Target Percentage” means the Service Levels defined in 8.2 (Service Levels).“Unqualified Outage(s)” means an Outage(s) that can be attributed to the listed availability exclusions as set forth in Section 8.6(Exclusions).Source: QUANTUM GROUP INC /FL, 8-K, 1/20/2009Service LevelsIBM will provide the following monthly availability Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) for the Services provided by IBM:For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are not clustered or configured in a high availabilityconfiguration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.7 percent.For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availabilityconfiguration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent.For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availabilityconfiguration, the SLA is a minimum of 98.0 percent.For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that is not clustered or configured in a high availabilityconfiguration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.5 percent.For Basic Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (includingpower, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments,switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections).For Advanced Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components(including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLANsegments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections).Availability CreditsIf in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for a Qualifying Server is less than theSLA Target Percentage for that Qualifying Server, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b),8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7.If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for Basic Monitoring or AdvancedMonitoring Services is less than the SLA Target Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services, Customer shall beeligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7.Customer agrees to contact the IBM Help Desk to report problems and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outageevent.Settlement of CreditsAvailability Credits will be aggregated on a quarterly basis and settled by the last day of the first month following the end of the quarterin which such Availability Credits were earned. (For example, the aggregate Availability Credits earned in the first quarter 2007 will beapplied against Monthly Recurring Charge for Services the Customer incurs in the April 2007 invoice.) Any Availability Credits owed fromIBM to Customer upon the expiration or termination of the Services will be paid within one (1) month following the effective date ofexpiration or termination. If the Monthly Recurring Charge for a subject month has not been incurred, or for any other reason has beencredited or waived, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit for that month. Customer shall receive no more than fivepercent (5%) of Customer’s Monthly Recurring Charge for Managed Hosting Services as an Availability Credit in a given month.Commencement of Service Level AgreementIBM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet the SLA Target Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shallnot be eligible for an Availability Credit until the first full calendar month following the Hosting Service Ready Date.Exclusivity of RemediesCustomer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM’s failure to meet an SLA Target Percentage is the Availability Credit as provided in thisAttachment.ExclusionsIBM is not responsible for any Outage outside of its control, including but not limited to, the following examples:periods of scheduled or emergency maintenance activities or scheduled Outage;Outage due to problems with Customer provided Content or programming errors including, but not limited to, Content installation andintegration;Source: QUANTUM GROUP INC /FL, 8-K, 1/20/2009Outage due to system administration, commands, file transfers performed by Customer representatives;Outage due to work performed at Customer request (for example TM assistance);other activities Customer directs, denial of service attacks, natural disasters, changes resulting from government, political, or otherregulatory actions or court orders, strikes or labor disputes, acts of civil disobedience, acts of war, acts against parties (includingcarriers and IBM’s other vendors), and other force majeure items;lack of availability or untimely response time of Customer to respond to incidents that require its participation for source identificationand/or resolution, including meeting Customer responsibilities for any prerequisite Services;Outage due to Customer breach of its material obligations under the Base Terms;Outages caused by Customer Content or Customer initiated patches;Outages caused by Customer not approving applying IBM recommended OS patches;Outages caused by the Customer not approving applying of OS maintenance releases;Periods where the Customer may have been granted System Administration rights;Customer denies IBM recommended software patches, hardware and/or OS changes;.
