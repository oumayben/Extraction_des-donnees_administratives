SAP ensures that customersalways receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available. Integrated Support for SAP and Partner ProductsSAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have providedLicensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamlesssupport. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respectivepartner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so. Access to SAPs Frontend (formerly: OSS)SAPsFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication betweencustomers and SAP. Features include:- Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads- Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads- Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software- Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)- Access to SAPs request handling process.Support ServicesThe requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAPs Global Support Network is a remoteconnection from the customers Software System to SAPs Frontend. This enables theefficient usage of SAPs portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work withthe SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their- 59 - TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1messages.Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problemmessages pertaining to:- An error in the software- An error in the software causes subsequent errors- There are problems when implementing corrections- There is no training or documentation available- The functions are not logical- The software ergonomics has flawsMessages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAPs Frontend.Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAPsRemote Consulting department, the customers implementation consultants or SAPconsultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of themaintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:- Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens and printouts, etc. )- Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system- Errors caused by a modification of the system- A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system errorMaintenance Service LevelsOptimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAPs Support organisation.SAPs Support process uses a three-tier Support structure: Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers.During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating tosupport in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the-60- TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01 appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries areentered via SAP s Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching. Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional SupportCentres)Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia,USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). TheseCentres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24hsupport network. According to the FoIlow-the-Sun principle, inquiries received outsidenormal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that iscurrently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operationwith SAP customers. Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)SAP Africas Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub-Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively,the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in whichevent, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with theservice levels stipulated in the table below.The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisationare certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement(SLA) and SAPs Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwardedsmoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensorsshall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned InitialReaction Times and Projected Resolution Times ("PRT") are achieved in 80% of all cases;PriorityVery High (1)High (2)Medium (3)Low (4)Initial Reaction Time(IRT)30 minutes2 hours4 hours8 hoursProjected Resolution Time(PRT)1 day3 days7 days1 4 daysPriority 1: d, h, min days, hours, minutes in actual timePriority 2, 3, 4: d, h, min days, hours, minutes during office hours- 61 - TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP ("Send toSAP" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the messagestatus.The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing asolution.Priorities of messages are defined as follows: Very High or Priority 1A message with priority "Very high" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-dayoperations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed,due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAPsystem.This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in seriouslosses. High or Priority 2A message with priority "High" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operationsare encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failedfunction in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause aserious interruption in the entire production system. Medium or Priority 3A message with priority "Medium" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations areencountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system. Low or Priority 4A message with priority "Low" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or onlyaffected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in thesystem that is not used daily or is only used rarely.(Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower thanthe identical problem in a production system).- 62 - TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions andnegotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/orpercentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may bepayable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and otheraspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for theSOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain marketconditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where theSOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any suchamendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referredfor determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa ("AFSA") in accordancewith the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA uponapplication by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint asuitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case ofmanifest error, the arbitrators ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall bewithout prejudice to a partys other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.- 6 3 - TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01 Customer Message SupportThe process of customer message support is the interface between development andservice. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording,preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problemanalysis.Life Cycle of a Customer MessageRefer to accompanying PDF for diagram Telkom customers can access the SAPs Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and createtheir own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received inwriting via fax (27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the LocalSupport Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAPs internal customer supportsystem. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAPsupport organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on thecomponents assigned to it.Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting informationThe processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry hasalready been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This searchis conducted semi-automatically in SAPs support system. If an entry is found containing asolution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified inwriting via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.Problem AnalysisIf, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must behandled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional- 64 - TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find asolution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level.The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of thedevelopment areas.If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP withsufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problemand to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customerssystem, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customers operations). If thisreproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additionalanalyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, theproblem receives the status of "customer action" in the support system. If special handling byan expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.Escalation ManagementIn the event of SAPs Support Management deciding that the standard support processes areinsufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) aformal escalation process is invoked.During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely(via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under thedirect supervision of SAPs management and the customer will not incur any costs.A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will takeplace once the critical issue has been resolved.During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA andTELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailedescalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors willprovide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the "go-live" stage. Theparties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOMS needsand business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.-65- TELKOM CONTRACTN0. 076C/01THUS DONE AND SIGNED at WOODMEAD by SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS(AFRICA) (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED on this 31st day of March 2001 /S/ /S/ (who warrants his authority to so sign)For: TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED (who warrants his authority to so sign)/s/ THUS DONE AND SIGNED at Pretoria by the TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED on this 31st day of March 2001 in the presence of the undersigned witnesses AS WITNESSES Signature /S/ Signature /S/ - 66 - TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01ANNEXURE 3toAGREEMENTbetweenSYSTEMS APPLICATION PRODUCTS (AFRICA) (PTY) LTDwithTELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED1.
