A transfer occurs when: (1) theoriginal or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the Software to another entity, or (2) the original lessor ofCisco used hardware (including bundled Software) ("Hardware") tries to reassign the original lessees right to use the Software to another lessee,or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the Hardware and Software bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the sameas the lease situation as described in item 2 above.This policy applies to all Software whether Standalone or Embedded. Standalone Software is Software which is not required to operate theHardware upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded Software isSoftware which is incorporated into the Hardware and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of IOS).Policy:Ciscos policy is that Software, whether Standalone or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, ofcourse, where Ciscos contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see Global Price List). Forproducts where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a feecannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customermay be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Ciscoauthorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.Use of the Software will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between Cisco and the original Software licenseeor by the new license between Cisco and the new user. Cisco may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy.License Fee:The License Fee is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise notedon the Global Price List.It is the obligation of the transferor to obtain Ciscos consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs.Exceptions:Provided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without writtenapproval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governingthe transferability of Special License Software (Special License Software is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG Product)Affiliate: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to its Affiliate. An Affiliate is another entity where at least 50.1% of itsvoting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where as least 50.1% of the transferring entitys voting power is owned orcontrolled by the transferee.Merger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of Software to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capitalstock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferors business to which those licenses pertain.Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the endof the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new License Fee, provided leasing company gives Ciscoprior written notice. Also, if the original lessee/customer defaults under the lease and the leasing company takes the equipment back before theend of the lease term, the leasing company may transfer the license to the another lessee for the remainder of the original lease term, withoutpaying Cisco a License Fee, upon 30 days prior written notice to Cisco, or as soon as practicable if the equipment is re-leased before such 30- dayperiod. If the new lease term is inSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019Exhibit 10.38excess of the original lease term, the leasing company is expected to pay Cisco a new License Fee on or before the expiration date of the originallease term. [NOTE: In the situation where a leasing company leases Cisco equipment to Customer A for a specified term and at the end of the leaseterm, the leasing company desires to lease the same equipment to Customer B, leasing company may not transfer the license without obtaining anew license from Cisco.)].Outsource: Customer desires to outsource the operation, support and maintenance of its network to a third party (e.g. EDS) ("Third-Party ServiceProvider"), for the benefit of that customer. As part of the outsourcing, customer transfers all of its rights, title and interest to the assets, includingcertain Cisco products and software licenses, to the Third-Party Service Provider.

These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovationand development driving changes in the product, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer technology.While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies toreview the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, we have setout below Ciscos end-of-life policy to help customers better manage their end-of-life transition and to understand the role that Cisco can play inhelping to migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technology.The End of Life Policy only applies to End of Life and End of Sale announcements made in all Theaters on or after November 30, 2002 for all Ciscoproduct lines. The Policy does not apply to product that is already subject to an End of Life and/or End of Sale announcement.The general policy guidelines are:1.As a general rule, Cisco will provide 6 months notice of the affected products end-of-sale date and/or the last day when the affectedproduct can be ordered. This notice will appear on Cisco.com site (http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_end_of_life.html) and weencourage you to visit this site regularly as it contains useful information regarding Ciscos end-of-life program.

Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgraderelease to correct a reported problem.c.After the first year and for Application SW -where available - we will provide bug fixes, maintenance releases, workarounds orpatches for a period of 2 years for application software. Bear in mind that it may be necessary to use software upgrade release tocorrect a reported problem.5.You will need to ensure that you have a current and fully paid support contract with Cisco. Please contact your Support AccountManager regarding fees payable during the end-of-life period so that we can support you right through the end-of-life transition period.6.Below are guidelines that should be followed to ensure that you receive effective support for the affected products within your network:a.For hardware or software that is not covered under a service contract, customers may add the product(s) to a current contract orpurchase a new contract until 12 months after the end-of-sale date.b.Service contracts that have not been renewed or have lapsed after 12 months of end-of sale date are not re-newable.c.Renewal of your service contract will generally be available until the last year of support, but will not extendSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019Exhibit 10.38beyond the last date of support.The end-of-life milestones and Cisco commitments are presented in Table 1.Table 1.
