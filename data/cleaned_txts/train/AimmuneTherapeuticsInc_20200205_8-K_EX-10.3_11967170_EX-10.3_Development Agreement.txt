February 5, 2020 Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments forpotentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize theinvestigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb7195 from Xencor, Inc.XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinctmechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctivetreatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODITTM) programs, including PALFORZIATM, to explore treatment outcomes inpatients with food allergies.“As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels ofdesensitization and perhaps even remission when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,” said Jayson Dallas, M.D.,President and CEO of Aimmune. “In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune’s globalleadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.”“Aimmune’s focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highlycomplementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,” said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO ofXencor. “AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reductionwould synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.”Under the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of 5 million in cash and 5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at 32.0025/share.

Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs relatedto the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.About AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb7195)AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts withallergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic responseSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive Bcells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.About AimmuneAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions forpatients with food allergies.
