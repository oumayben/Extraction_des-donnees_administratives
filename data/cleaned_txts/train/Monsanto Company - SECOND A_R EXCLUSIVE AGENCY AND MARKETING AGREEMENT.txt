In the event that the Agent is terminated as an exclusivedistributor of the Roundup Pro SKU by Monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell orcommercialize the Roundup Pro SKU), any subsequent sales of the Roundup Pro SKU by parties other than Agent in the Lawnand Garden Channels in the United States will be subject to the provisions of Section 3.8(c) below.(c) Except to the extent provided in Section 3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use itsreasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels toconsumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets.
