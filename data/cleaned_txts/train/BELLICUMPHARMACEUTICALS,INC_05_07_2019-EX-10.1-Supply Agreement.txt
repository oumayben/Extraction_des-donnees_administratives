Each Party shall appoint an appropriately qualified individual to serve as an alliance manager under this Agreement(the “Alliance Manager”). Such persons shall endeavor to assure clear and responsive communication between the Parties and theeffective exchange of information, and may serve as the primary point of contact for any matters arising under this Agreement. TheAlliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties’ good faith discussions,and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.9Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)(b) Joint Steering Committee. The Parties hereby establish a joint steering committee (the “JSC”) that will monitor and provide strategicoversight of the activities under this Agreement, and facilitate communications between the Parties with respect to the supply of MiltenyiProducts and Bellicum’s development and commercialization of Bellicum Products. Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3)representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non-voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising withinthe scope of the JSC’s responsibilities. The Parties’ initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30)days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replaceits JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace arepresentative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not beunreasonably withheld.

The JSC has noauthority to modify this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or any Module.ARTICLE 3 PRODUCT QUALITY; CHANGE CONTROL3.1 Product Quality.(a) Product Specifications. Miltenyi shall manufacture or have manufactured the Miltenyi Products to meet the agreed ProductSpecifications, as then in effect, as published by Miltenyi from time to time, or as set forth in the Quality Agreement, as applicable.(b) Agreed Standards. All Miltenyi Products shall be manufactured and quality controlled in compliance with and pursuant to: (i) theAgreed Standards, (ii) the requirements of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, and (iii) Applicable Laws.(c) Testing. Miltenyi shall have standard analytical testing performed on each batch of Miltenyi Product to be shipped to Bellicum, inaccordance with Agreed Standards and the procedures described in the corresponding documentation, to verify that Miltenyi Productmeets Product Specifications and that it was manufactured in accordance with Agreed Standards and Applicable Laws.(d) Quality System. All Miltenyi Products supplied under this Agreement shall be manufactured and quality controlled under an appropriatequality system in accordance with Agreed Standards, as more fully described in the Quality Agreement (as applicable). Any subsequentchange to Miltenyi’s quality system that, as Bellicum can reasonably establish, would have or is likely to have a material effect on thesafety, efficacy, identity and/or quality of a Miltenyi Product or its Permitted Use, requires the Parties to discuss and agree upon each suchchange in writing.10Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)(e) Quality Agreement. Within [......] days from the Effective Date (or such longer period as agreed by the Parties in writing, but inany event prior to the first delivery of Clinical Grade Product to Bellicum), the Parties shall enter into an agreement on mutuallyacceptable, commercially reasonable terms that details the quality assurance obligations of each Party relating to Clinical Grade Products(the “Quality Agreement”). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, theprovisions of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the Quality Agreement shall govern in respect of quality issues.3.2 Change Control.(a) General. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Section 3.2 and in the Quality Agreement, and unless otherwise agreedbetween the Parties in writing from time to time, Miltenyi reserves the right to periodically make changes to the Product Specifications,Agreed Standards and/or otherwise with respect to the properties, manufacture and/or testing of the Miltenyi Products (including changeswith respect to: suppliers of raw materials; quality in raw materials; methods of manufacturing; packaging; equipment and/or premises;Subcontractors; product control techniques and methods of analysis; product release specifications; and/or presentation and content ofrelevant documentation, including certificates pursuant to Section 6.5) from time to time during the Term (each, a “Change”).(b) Change Notification. Change notifications shall be provided in accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in theQuality Agreement or in this Agreement. In the event that Miltenyi proposes a Material Change, unless such proposed Change is aRequired Change pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below and there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation of such Required Change,Miltenyi shall give Bellicum at least [......] months’ advance written notice prior to implementation of the proposed Material Change (a“Change Notification”). Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum all informationreasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding any Change under thissubsection, if applicable.(c) Changes Required for Compliance. If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made byRegulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonablejudgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally (in each case, a“Required Change”), Miltenyi shall use [......] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a RequiredChange is specifically related to the use of Miltenyi Product for a Permitted Use in relation to a Bellicum Product (a “Bellicum-SpecificRequired Change”), then Miltenyi shall use [......] to implement such Bellicum-Specific Required Change only if and to the extentBellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of any suchBellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), Miltenyi shallpromptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change, ifany. Miltenyi and Bellicum shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement on (i) the new Product Price, if any, for anyMiltenyi Product which embodies such Required Change, giving due consideration to the effect of such change on Miltenyi’smanufacturing costs for the changed Miltenyi Product as well as any other relevant factors, (ii) the responsibility for any costs andexpenses associated with Miltenyi’s activities required to implement such Change, and (iii) any other amendments to this Agreement whichmay be necessitated by such Change (e.g., an adjustment to the lead time for firm orders). For clarity, Miltenyi shall have no obligation toimplement a Bellicum-Specific Required Change unless and until the Parties have reached agreement on all items as described in thepreceding sentence.(d) Changes Requested by Bellicum. If during the Term Bellicum desires Miltenyi to make any Change not necessary to comply withchanges in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory11Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a “Bellicum-Requested Change”), Bellicumshall notify Miltenyi thereof in writing. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi’sconsent. Miltenyi may withhold its consent to an Bellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) doesnot comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi’s applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could havepotential adverse impact on Miltenyi’s manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. Inaddition, a Bellicum-Requested Change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted aspromptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by Miltenyi, at Bellicum’s cost, and shall be subject to Miltenyi and Bellicum reachingagreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product Price necessitated by any such Bellicum-Requested Change. If Bellicumagrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change and accepts a proposed Product Price adjustment that reflects a change in Miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting fromsuch Bellicum-Requested Change, Miltenyi shall use [......] to implement the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change. For clarity, anagreed adjustment to the Product Price shall become effective only with respect to orders for Miltenyi Products that are manufactured inaccordance with the Bellicum-Requested Change.(e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply withchanges in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in eachcase, a “Miltenyi-Requested Change”), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth inSection 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advancewritten notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its bestefforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the “Changed Miltenyi Product” (meaning suchMiltenyi Product that is produced under conditions of the Miltenyi-Requested Change) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as suchChanged Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevantdocumentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with theapplicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatoryapprovals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own costand expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum’s perspective, then anylimitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to MiltenyiProducts affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any suchChanged Miltenyi Products.(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Parties shall cooperate, share information, and otherwiseact in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals ormanufacturing permits for Miltenyi Product and Bellicum Product, respectively.(g) Continued Supply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of aproposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested byBellicum, discussed with Bellicum in good faith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Changefor as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [......], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any requiredamendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six(6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi’s Change Notification pursuant to Section3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product12Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)Price necessitated by any such continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product during such period. Until such agreement is reached, anylimitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to MiltenyiProducts described in this subsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Productsproduced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g)is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified ina Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy thesituation.(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (g), in the event that Bellicum reasonably determines to reject a proposedMaterial Change (including a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi will continue to supply the applicable Miltenyi Product without suchchange after expiry of the said 6-month period and during the Term of this Agreement, or until Bellicum has secured an alternate source ofsupply from a Third Party manufacturer; provided, however, that the Parties will discuss in good faith, reflecting the change incircumstances contemplated by this Section 3.2(h), and agree in writing upon commercially reasonable terms to be set forth in anamendment to this Agreement to reflect any demonstrable increased cost and effort (if any) resulting from the manufacture of unchangedMiltenyi Product solely for Bellicum, including (as an example) any applicable adjustments to Forecasts, Lead Times, production cycles,batch sizes, Delivery Dates, Product Prices, or other relevant issues. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding such amendment,any obligations of Bellicum in relation to a Forecast for the affected Miltentyi Product in months 7-12 of the applicable Monthly Forecast,and any limitations regarding forecast variances, as each of these are set forth in Article 5, will not apply to a Miltenyi Product producedafter implementation of such Material Change (i.e., one that replaces such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product), and Miltenyi shall berelieved from any obligations to supply such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product under this Agreement after the period described in thefirst sentence of this subsection (h) ends. For clarity, in no event shall Miltenyi be required to manufacture, supply or sell an existingMiltenyi Product to which a Required Change must be applied.(i) Research Grade Products. The notification requirements of the second sentence of Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement with respect toMaterial Changes and the obligations of Section 3.2(g) with respect to Continued Supply shall not apply to Research Grade Products.(j) Costs. Bellicum shall have responsibility for any Regulatory Authority filing fees and other costs and expenses incurred by Bellicum inconnection with any filing or required amendment or other modification of regulatory approvals or consents for Bellicum Product resultingfrom any Change pursuant this Section 3.2, if applicable.ARTICLE 4 REGULATORY4.1 Regulatory Responsibility.(a) Bellicum Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Miltenyi Products that are solely reserved by Miltenyi under thisAgreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Bellicum will be solely responsible for all regulatoryactivities with respect to any Bellicum Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.(b) Miltenyi Product(s).

Bellicum hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set out with respect to any Miltenyi Product in theProduct Specifications or in the Quality Agreement, as13Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)applicable, the Miltenyi Products have no approvals by Regulatory Authorities in the Territory for use in diagnostic or therapeuticprocedures or other clinical applications, or for any other use requiring compliance with any law or regulation regulating clinical,diagnostic or therapeutic products or any similar product (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Regulatory Laws”). Bellicum furtheracknowledges and agrees that Miltenyi Products have not yet been fully tested or validated for safety or effectiveness in connection withBellicum’s Permitted Use. Save as set out in the Product Specifications or the applicable Quality Agreement, it shall be the soleresponsibility of Bellicum to test and validate the Miltenyi Products for Bellicum’s contemplated Permitted Use hereunder and to take allother actions necessary to establish compliance of Bellicum’s Permitted Use thereof with all regulatory requirements, and to ensure thatany Bellicum Product resulting from such Permitted Use meets all applicable safety, quality, or other regulatory requirements (includingRegulatory Laws), in each case prior to the first use of such Miltenyi Product.(d) The Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder may not be used for any purpose that would require Regulatory Authority approvals orconsents unless such proper Regulatory Authority approvals or consents have been obtained. Bellicum agrees that if it elects to use, orcauses any Bellicum Subcontractor or Licensee to use, any Miltenyi Products for a purpose that would subject Miltenyi or such MiltenyiProducts to the jurisdiction of any Regulatory Laws, Bellicum will be solely responsible for obtaining any required Regulatory Authorityapprovals or consents, and for otherwise ensuring that Bellicum’s (or its Subcontractors’ or Licensees’) use of such Miltenyi Products forsuch purpose complies with such Regulatory Laws. Bellicum shall defend and indemnify Miltenyi and its Affiliates against any liability,damage, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of Bellicum’s failure to obtain all necessary Regulatory Authority approvals orconsents or to comply with any Regulatory Laws in relation to Bellicum’s use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose.4.2 Regulatory Authority Requirements. Miltenyi states that (i) Miltenyi is obliged by relevant Regulatory Authorities to keep a record of allof its customer’s clinical trials that use Miltenyi Products (name and title of clinical trials, the official registration numbers, name andaddresses of the involved principal investigators and clinical trial centers as well as the corresponding formal document granting approvalof an IND (for example only, IND/CTA acknowledgement letter of the relevant Regulatory Authority(ies) involving the use of “IDE/CRR”-labelled Miltenyi Products)) (regardless of whether such clinical trials are sponsored by Miltenyi or by any Third Party); and (ii) Miltenyi isnot permitted to provide “IDE/CRR”-labeled Miltenyi Products to customers in the United States for use in clinical trials if the IND or IDEis not approved by the respective regulatory authority or rejected. . Miltenyi shall act and shall have no liability to Bellicum for acting inaccordance with the foregoing requirements. As used herein, “CTA” means a clinical trial application; “IDE” means an investigationaldevice exemption; and “IDE/CRR” references a certain subset of Miltenyi Products labeled with the “IDE/CRR” designation.4.3 Regulatory Work. Miltenyi has established, or may from time to time establish, Master Files for one or more Miltenyi Products withone or more Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Miltenyi shall maintain each such Master File in accordance with Applicable Laws(“Regulatory Work”).

Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any material communicationfrom any Regulatory Authority that is related specifically to (i) the safety and/or functionality of any Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the usethereof for the manufacture of Bellicum Product or (ii) the safety and/or functionality of any Bellicum Product(s) as the same relate orcould relate to a Miltenyi Product and/or the use of Miltenyi Product(s) in the manufacture of Bellicum Product(s), and that would, ineach case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either Party’s products that are the subject matter ofthis Agreement, or ability of a Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (collectively, “Communication(s)”). Each Partyshall, as soon as practicable after any contact with or receipt of any Communication, forward a copy or description of the same (to theextent it so relates) to the other Party. Each Party reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Partyinformation from such Communications. Each Party shall obligate its Affiliates and Subcontractors accordingly.(b) Communication to Regulatory Authorities. In the event that a response to a Regulatory Authority is required in connection with anyCommunication, Bellicum will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a RegulatoryAuthority in connection with any regulatory submission regarding a Bellicum Product, or any non-Miltenyi Product component thereof(Miltenyi will provide its proposed response regarding any Miltenyi Product component thereof), and any non-product-specificinformation and/or non-procedure-specific information related to Bellicum, and Miltenyi will have sole responsibility for the form andcontent of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority regarding a Miltenyi Product regulatory submission or anycomponent thereof, the Master Files, and any non-product specific information related to Miltenyi. If Miltenyi’s response is requested andneeded in connection with any Bellicum Product regulatory submission, and a delayed response is likely to delay development orcommercialization of such Bellicum Product, then Miltenyi will promptly use its diligent efforts to provide such response as soon aspracticable. At the responding Party’s reasonable request and expense, the other Party will collaborate in good faith with the respondingParty in preparing such responses and, subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, will provide the responding15Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)Party with information that the responding Party reasonably believes is required to develop a requested response for questions in relationto such Communication.(c) Required Communications. If Bellicum is required to communicate with any Regulatory Authority specifically regarding any MiltenyiProduct, then Bellicum shall so advise Miltenyi as soon as practicable and, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, or to the extent that sucha disclosure would result in the violation of any contractual obligations to a Third Party, provide Miltenyi in advance with a copy of anyproposed written Communication with such Regulatory Authority to the extent that such Communication pertains to Miltenyi Products;provided that Bellicum reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such copy.Bellicum shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all reasonable direction of Miltenyi pertaining to the foregoing. To the extent permittedby the Regulatory Authority, Miltenyi shall have the right to participate in any planned oral Communications or meetings between Bellicumand any Regulatory Authority specifically relating to Miltenyi Products or Miltenyi Technology. For purposes of clarification, theobligations imposed on Bellicum pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall not apply with respect to Communications with RegulatoryAuthorities that are focused primarily on a non-Miltenyi Product portions or on a Bellicum Product.4.8 Assistance. Miltenyi shall, if requested by Bellicum, consult with and provide reasonable assistance to Bellicum with regard toregulatory matters concerning the Miltenyi Products, as appropriate, provided that for any assistance regarding regulatory matters that isbeyond the scope of standard use of the Miltenyi Products as made available in Miltenyi’s catalogue, Bellicum shall pay for Miltenyi’s timefor such consulting and assistance at Miltenyi’s then-standard rates, which scope and limits shall be discussed between the Parties andmutually agreed in writing prior to the performance of the assistance by Miltenyi (subject to the Parties’ representations, warranties andliabilities under this Agreement). Absent Miltenyi’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Bellicum shall bear all responsibility forBellicum’s or Bellicum Subcontractors’ use of information provided by Miltenyi (including use in regulatory filings and any Third Partyliability) pursuant to this Section 4.8.4.9 Additional Filings. Bellicum acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Master Files in relation to Miltenyi’s supply obligations havenot been filed in all jurisdictions worldwide. If Bellicum desires to pursue clinical evaluations related to the approvability or approval of anyBellicum Product or decides to pursue commercialization of any Bellicum Product in any jurisdiction where Miltenyi does not then have anactive Master File, and Bellicum would not legally be able to conduct such evaluation or commercialization without Miltenyi filing a MasterFile in such jurisdiction or making necessary information available to the Regulatory Authority, then Bellicum shall so notify Miltenyi, andthe Parties shall discuss in good faith the terms and conditions under which Miltenyi would be willing to file such Master File or providenecessary information to the Regulatory Authority including additional compensation to Miltenyi (if any), but Miltenyi shall not be obligatedto file such Master File or provide such information, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing on such commercially reasonable termsand conditions. To the extent requested by Bellicum in writing from time to time to amend the Bellicum Product specific Module to includeAdditional Countries, Miltenyi shall work in good faith with Bellicum to include such Additional Countries in accordance with theprovisions of Section 2.3 supra.4.10 Disclaimer. Except as provided in this Article 4 or otherwise in the Agreement, Miltenyi provides no warranty that any Master File orother regulatory dossier or submission by Miltenyi or Bellicum will be approved by any Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall in no way beheld responsible for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority or ethics committee to grant permission to conduct a clinical trial(s) and/orfor any refusal by any Regulatory Authority to grant approval under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or under a BiologicalLicense Application (BLA) or for compassionate use for a Bellicum Product.16Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)ARTICLE 5 FORECASTS AND ORDERS5.1 Forecasts. In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework forforecasting Bellicum’s orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agreesto provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum’s (and its Subcontractors’ and Licensees’) anticipated quantity requirements forMiltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1(each, a “Forecast”). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitlyagreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplementthis Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided underthis Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) andmanufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreedMiltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum’santicipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [......] in preparing allForecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorizedrepresentative of Bellicum (or Bellicum’s designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile,and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.(a) Rolling Monthly Forecast; Firm Zone. Within [......] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [......] day ofeach Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a monthly rolling Forecast of Bellicum’s anticipated quantity requirements forMiltenyi Products within the Forecast Territory (on a manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis) for each of the next twelve(12) consecutive Calendar Months (e.g., year 1: months 1-12), commencing with the Calendar Month in which such Forecast issubmitted (each, a “Monthly Forecast”). (For clarity, the initial Monthly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 1, i.e., Calendar Months 1-12;the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous MonthlyForecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1st)three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for MiltenyiProducts submitted during the Term, [......] percent ([......]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1st) three (3) month periodof each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the “Firm Zone”) shall be binding, and the correspondingportion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity, all forecasted quantities of MiltenyiProducts during the Firm Zone shall constitute a binding commitment by Bellicum to submit corresponding Purchase Orders for MiltenyiProducts. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, aMonthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.(b) Rolling Quarterly Forecast. Within [......] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [......] day of each lastmonth of a Calendar Quarter during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a non-binding quarterly rolling Forecast of Bellicum’s anticipatedquantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the four (4) Calendar Quarters immediately following the last month of suchCalendar Quarter (each, a “Quarterly Forecast”). Each Quarterly Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on a quarterlybasis. (For clarity, the initial Quarterly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 2, i.e. Calendar Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 (covering Calendar Months13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 22-24); the following Quarterly Forecast will cover the four Calendar Quarter period following the CalendarQuarter 1 of the previous Quarterly Forecast, i.e. Calendar Quarters 2-5.) A Quarterly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be bindingupon both Parties.17Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)(c) Long-Term Forecast. In addition, Bellicum (or Bellicum’s designee on behalf of Bellicum) shall within [......] days of the EffectiveDate, and thereafter by [......] of each Calendar Year during the Term, submit a non-binding annual rolling Forecast of Bellicum’santicipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the next three (3) consecutive Calendar Years, commencing with theCalendar Year in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a “Long-Term Forecast”) for the purposes of assisting Miltenyi with its capacityand production planning for Miltenyi Products during such period. Each Long-Term Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirementson an annual basis. (For clarity, the initial Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years 3 to 5; the following Long-Term Forecastwill cover the Calendar Years period following the previous Calendar Year 3 of the previous Long-Term Forecast, i.e. Calendar Years 4-5.)A Long Term Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties and shall serve to assess future capacity planning atMiltenyi.(d) Forecasts Due Periodically. In the event that Miltenyi has failed to receive an updated Forecast for any relevant forecast period withinthe times or by the dates provided in clauses (a) through (c) above, Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of such failure in writing and,if Bellicum fails to respond with an updated Forecast by the [......] day of a Calendar Month of the relevant forecast period, the mostrecent Forecast shall be regarded as current.(e) Acceptable Forecast Variance. Outside the Firm Zone, Bellicum may increase or decrease the amount of Miltenyi Product forecast foreach Calendar Month of each Monthly Forecast by up to [......] percent ([......]%) for Calendar Months 4 through 6, and by[......] percent ([......]%) for Calendar Months 7 through 12, compared to the amount of Miltenyi Product that was forecast for thecomparable Calendar Month in the prior Monthly Forecast provided in accordance with this Agreement, on a product-by-product andcountry-by-country basis, (e.g., the forecast for the fourth Calendar Month in a Monthly Forecast may not increase or decrease by morethan [......]% of the amount of any particular Miltenyi Product in any particular country forecast for the fifth Calendar Month of theprior Monthly Forecast). For clarity, variances with respect to forecasts submitted for any Calendar Month within the Firm Zone shall notbe acceptable.5.2 Volume Limitations.(a) Subject to Bellicum’s adherence to its Forecast obligations pursuant to Section 5.1 above, or as specifically modified in a specificModule, Miltenyi shall meet the demands of any Purchase Orders (as defined below) that are made by Bellicum in compliance with theForecasts. Miltenyi shall not be obligated to supply Bellicum with quantities of Miltenyi Product in excess of [......] percent([......]%) of the most recent Forecast provided to Miltenyi but agrees to use [......] to satisfy Bellicum’s requirement of MiltenyiProduct in excess of [......] percent ([......]%) of the relevant Forecast quantities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it is or will be unable to supply any desired quantity of Miltenyi Product pursuant to aPurchase Order that falls within the relevant Forecast on or before the applicable Delivery date(s) therefor, Miltenyi shall promptly informBellicum, and then, the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery. If Miltenyi fails to propose areasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery, Bellicum may, to be determined in Bellicum’s reasonable discretion and notwithstandinganything to the contrary in the Agreement, at its option, cancel the Purchase Order.5.3 Firm Zone Requirements. Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for eachCalendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreementshall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and ineach Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s)specified for the first (1st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast18Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)(such amount, the “Firm Zone Requirements”). The Firm Zone Requirement shall not apply within the first three months of the EffectiveDate of the Agreement. Within [......] days of the end of each Calendar Quarter, Miltenyi will calculate the total Firm ZoneRequirements for each of the three (3) Calendar Months during that Calendar Quarter. In the event that Bellicum fails to order the FirmZone Requirements of Miltenyi Product from Miltenyi during any particular Calendar Month in the relevant Calendar Quarter in whichMiltenyi was ready, willing and able to Deliver Miltenyi Product in accordance with the applicable Monthly Forecast, then the “Firm ZoneOrder Shortfall” shall be the total amount by which the Firm Zone Requirements for any given Calendar Month during such CalendarQuarter exceed the amount of Miltenyi Product actually ordered by Bellicum during such Calendar Month. Miltenyi will invoice Bellicumfor an amount equal to the Firm Zone Shortfall and Bellicum will pay such invoice within [......] days of the invoice date. UponBellicum’s request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum,provide Bellicum with Miltenyi’s remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfallamount.5.4 Purchase Orders. This Section 5.4 sets forth a general framework for Purchase Order-related terms and conditions, which shall applyunless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module.(a) Bellicum shall order Miltenyi Products by submitting written purchase orders to Miltenyi, in such form as the Parties may agree fromtime to time and in accordance with any applicable Lead Times and the provisions of this Article 5 (each, a “Purchase Order”). AllPurchase Orders (and any related acceptances or objections by Miltenyi) may be delivered electronically or by other means to Miltenyi’sapplicable sales representative located in the country of the shipping destination or to such location as Miltenyi shall reasonably designatefrom time to time.(b) Each Purchase Order will specify the MB Global Contract Number assigned to this Agreement, the volumes of Miltenyi Product(s)ordered, the desired Delivery date(s) the Miltenyi Products are to be made available to Bellicum for pick-up by Bellicums designatedcarrier or freight forwarder, the relevant ship-to address, and any special shipping instructions. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in adefined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.(c) Bellicum shall submit each Purchase Order to Miltenyi reasonably prior to the desired Delivery date(s), which shall be no sooner thanthe applicable Lead Time(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s); provided that absent an applicable Lead Time, the Purchase Order shall besubmitted at least [......] days in advance of the desired Delivery date specified in such Purchase Order; and provided further thatMiltenyi shall use diligent and good faith efforts to Deliver before the desiredDelivery date.(d) Purchase Orders shall be firm and binding upon written acceptance by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall confirm acceptance of the PurchaseOrder by written notice (sent by fax, mail, overnight courier or e-mail) to Bellicum within [......] Business Days of receipt of thePurchase Order from Bellicum. If Miltenyi fails to confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order within [......] Business Days of receipt ofthe Purchase Order from Bellicum, then Bellicum will contact Miltenyi to verify Miltenyi’s receipt and acceptance of such Purchase Orderand request written confirmation thereof from Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall accept all Purchase Orders for quantities of Miltenyi Product thatare within the Firm Zone Requirement amounts specified for the relevant Calendar Month in the applicable Monthly Forecast.(e) Each Purchase Order shall reference the MB Global Contract Reference Number (MBGCR) defined in the respective Modules,submitted by Bellicum to Miltenyi shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Module andthe applicable Quality Agreement. None of the terms and conditions set forth on any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance,objection or similar document shall change or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby agree that theterms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Module shall19Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)supersede any conflicting term or condition set forth in any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similardocument furnished by Bellicum to Miltenyi or by Miltenyi to Bellicum, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchase Ordersmay only contain products to be ordered under a single MBGCR. The combination of products referring to different MBGCR in onePurchase Order, or a combination of products referencing a MBGCR and products not referencing a MBGCR in one Purchase Order isnot possible.(f) In the event of a Bellicum Product safety issue, withdrawal or hold on use of a Bellicum Product by a Regulatory Authority or otherissue that directly results in a material reduction or elimination of Bellicum’s quantity requirements for a particular Miltenyi Product(s), theParties will discuss promptly and in good faith adjustments to the permitted forecast variance described in Section 5.1(e) during the periodwhen such circumstance exists, and other steps that could be taken to soften the impact of such circumstance on each Party.5.5 Changes to Purchase Orders. Subject to Section 5.2 and applicable Lead Times, Miltenyi shall use [......] to comply with unplannedchanges in Purchase Orders requested by Bellicum either in terms of quantities or Delivery dates. All requests for changes to PurchaseOrders shall be submitted in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all supplementary costs that result from the implementation of anyunplanned change to an accepted Purchase Order requested by Bellicum.5.6 Minimum Purchases. This Section 5.6 sets forth a general framework for Minimum Purchases-related terms and conditions, whichshall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module. In the eventBellicum’s aggregate purchases of Miltenyi Products from Miltenyi under this Agreement in any Calendar Year during the Term is less than[......]% of the Rolling Monthly Forecast subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, at the beginning of that Calendar Year or €[......]([......] Euros), whatever is higher, (the “Minimum Purchase”), then Miltenyi shall provide written notice to Bellicum of such shortfall.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the €[......] amount recited as an elementused to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to €[......]. Bellicum shall have [......] days to tendera firm Purchase Order for the purchase of such shortfall to satisfy the Minimum Purchase requirements set forth above. If Bellicum failsto tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [......]-day period,then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicums receipt of written notice of Miltenyis election to do so, shallhave no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;(2) to use [......] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalfof Bellicum; and(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3.Minimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicableForecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi andBellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment.ARTICLE 6 DELIVERY6.1 Delivery; Shipment.(a) Each quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in a particular Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement shall be deliveredFCA (Incoterms 2010) Miltenyi’s Facility by delivery20Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)of the shipped goods to Bellicum’s designated carrier or freight forwarder, in adequate packaging and ready for loading, on the DeliveryDate (“Delivery”).(b) Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum’s designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a “DeliveryDate”) confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal businesshours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall beresponsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi’s Facility to the ultimate destination and importcustoms clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum’s writtenrequest, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum’sresponsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the followingcosts and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi’sFacility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.(c) Upon Delivery, Bellicum will cause its carrier to verify the gross and visually observable physical integrity of all Miltenyi Productpackaging prior to loading and to acknowledge proper receipt of the Miltenyi Products by signing the relevant transport documentation.(d) Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products appropriately labelled with a traceable lot or batch number and packaged for shipping incommercial packaging materials in compliance with Agreed Standards, Miltenyi’s standard procedures and, the applicable QualityAgreement.(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from thequantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums’ prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to avariance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only beinvoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee. Inthe event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyishall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but notactually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, thenBellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay.6.2 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to Miltenyi Products shall pass to Bellicum as defined by Incoterm FCA (Incoterms2010). Should any of the Delivered Miltenyi Products be damaged during transit to Bellicum or Bellicum’s designee, then notwithstandinganything to the contrary in Section 5.4, a replacement order to replace such damaged Miltenyi Products shall be fulfilled, even if thevolume limitations defined in Section 5.2 are exceeded, by Miltenyi in good faith and as soon as practicable (and such replacement ordershall be considered a new Purchase Order during the applicable Firm Zone).6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum’s specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to beseparately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments, Miltenyiwill pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments.6.4 Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped MiltenyiProduct shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time bywritten notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products isrelatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed21Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)ordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [......]to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b)improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree toprovide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into accountcost, resource and capacity requirements.6.5 Certificates. Miltenyi shall include proper release certificates, certificates of compliance, and/or certificates of analysis with allshipments of Miltenyi Product, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement.6.6 Product Shortage. Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of any potential or anticipated shortfall in the manufacturing or inventory ofany Miltenyi Product that may adversely affect the Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with Bellicum’s forecast requirementsand pending Purchase Orders therefor. If Miltenyi is unable to supply any Miltenyi Product subject to a pending Purchase Order for anyreason, then the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery and Miltenyi shall undertake prompt anddiligent efforts to mitigate the adverse impact on Bellicum. In the case of a limited availability of any Miltenyi Product, in selling suchMiltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall take into account the aggregate volume of Miltenyi Products purchased by Bellicum, and shall subject toreasonable ethical standards provide to Bellicum priority access to Miltenyi Product consistent with such Miltenyi Product purchasevolumes and critical medical needs. If due to the fault or error of Miltenyi or a Third-Party supplier or Subcontractor of Miltenyi or ForceMajeure, Miltenyi fails to deliver any Miltenyi Product in the quantities specified in Bellicums Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall use all[......] that may be necessary in order to minimize the shortfall, and deliver the ordered Miltenyi Product as soon as possible. IfMiltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery or if the delay is more than thirty (30) days following the confirmedDelivery Date, Bellicum may, at its reasonable election and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, cancel the PurchaseOrder(s) without penalty.6.7 Continuity of Supply.(a) Contingent upon Bellicum’s continued adherence to its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including the Forecastobligations and Firm Zone Requirements pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 above, Miltenyi shall use [......] have and devote adequatemanufacturing capacity to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Belicum in accordance with the Forecasts during the Term,in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7. However, Miltenyi’s compliance with this Section 6.7(a) shall not require Miltenyi toincur any significant expenses to purchase new equipment, to install equipment purchased or requested by Bellicum, or to add (or, forclarity, allocate or dedicate) additional manufacturing or storage capacity for the manufacturing and supply of Miltenyi Products toBellicum hereunder.(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it will not be able, or is likely not to be able, to produce all of Bellicum’s forecastrequirements of Miltenyi Products from its primary facility located in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, Miltenyi shall determine, at its optionand expense, to establish additional or alternative manufacturing and supply capability for the Miltenyi Products by qualifying andmaintaining one or more back-up manufacturing facilities at the premises of Miltenyi and/or any of its Affiliates (each, a “SecondaryLocation”). Use of a Secondary Location must be notified to Bellicum in writing in accordance with the Change Notification processes setforth in Section 3.2. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reasonable number of samples of the“Secondary Location Miltenyi Products” (meaning such Miltenyi Products that are produced at such Secondary Location) for evaluationby Bellicum as soon as each such Secondary Location Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. In the eventthat Miltenyi decides to qualify a Secondary Location for the supply of Miltenyi Products hereunder, it shall provide reasonable priorwritten notice thereof (not less than22Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)six (6) months in advance) to Bellicum, including such details as Bellicum reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of suchSecondary Location. Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for all activities in connection with the setup and approval of the SecondaryLocation, including for establishing proof of product equivalence for Miltenyi Products produced at the Secondary Location, process andequipment validation and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with Miltenyi’s applicable Regulatory Authorities in connectionwith the Secondary Location.(c) In addition, Miltenyi may from time to time determine, in its sole discretion, to have one or more Miltenyi Products manufactured,assembled and/or supplied, in whole or in part, by a Subcontractor chosen by Miltenyi and reasonably acceptable to Bellicum. Miltenyishall provide Bellicum with prior written notification of such Change in accordance with the applicable notification procedures as set forthin the Section Change Control and in the Quality Agreement, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miltenyi shall remain responsiblefor the fulfilment of its supply and other obligations hereunder with respect to any Miltenyi Product manufactured by Miltenyi’sSubcontractor. Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or othercorrespondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a ThirdParty subcontractor site for the Miltenyi Products. Further, Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for all process and equipment validationrequired by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to passgovernment inspection by such Regulatory Authorities(d) In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or moreMiltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product thatrequire a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventoryshall be reserved for Bellicum.6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase.If a given Module involves supply of Miltenyi Products for Bellicum’s Commercial Phase activities, Section 6.8(b) shall apply, providedthat additional terms and conditions regarding continuity of supply for such Commercial Phase activities pursuant to such Module havebeen negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon in such Module. The Parties acknowledge that provisions in such Module relatingto additional terms and conditions regarding such continuity of supply will depend on the specific Miltenyi Product(s) that are relevant tosuch Module, and further acknowledge that such provision(s) in such Module may be subject to the Parties’ good faith negotiation andmutual agreement regarding additional terms and conditions relevant to minimum purchase requirements (if any) for Miltenyi Product(s)under a Module.(a) Principal Terms.(1) In the event of a Supply Failure (as defined below), Bellicum shall have the option to request Miltenyi to establish, as soon asreasonably feasible and at Miltenyi’s sole cost and expense, a Secondary Location reasonably capable of making up the Supply Failure ofthe affected Miltenyi Product (the “Affected Miltenyi Product”), and if Miltenyi should either (i) notify Bellicum in writing that it is notwilling and/or capable to establish a Secondary Location, or (ii) should not have established such Secondary Location and made up theSupply Failure within a reasonable period of time with regard to the Affected Miltenyi Product from receipt of Bellicum’s written requesttherefore, then Bellicum shall, at Bellicum’s sole cost and expense, have the right to select, qualify, and maintain an additional secondsource manufacturing facility as a back-up manufacturing facility for the Affected Miltenyi Products at the premises of a Third Party (the“Second-Source Supplier”). In the event that Bellicum elects to qualify a Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product, it shallprovide Miltenyi with prior written notice to Miltenyi including such details as Miltenyi reasonably requires to assess the qualifications ofsuch Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall be subject to the prior written consent of Miltenyi, which23Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in Miltenyi’s reasonable judgment to protect the bona fideand legitimate interests of Miltenyi in protecting its proprietary Intellectual Property Rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., bydisclosure to a Miltenyi Competitor). If Miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative Second-Source Suppliers reasonablyacceptable to both Miltenyi and Bellicum. If the Parties fail to identify a mutually acceptable Second-Source Supplier within thirty (30)days, Bellicum may proceed with an alternative Second-Source Supplier of its choice (however not a Miltenyi Competitor) withoutMiltenyi’s consent.(2) For purposes hereof, each of the following events shall be deemed a “Supply Failure”:(i)if Miltenyi, using [......], fails to deliver to Bellicum at least [......]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-MiltenyiProduct basis) of an accepted Purchase Order of Miltenyi Product placed by Bellicum in accordance with therelevant binding Forecast within a reasonable period of time after the agreed Delivery Date therefor (whether byreason of Force Majeure or otherwise) more than twice during any Calendar Year; provided, however, that any of theforegoing events shall not be considered a Supply Failure to the extent that it results from:(x) an act or omission of Bellicum, including any specific written instructions or requirements issued by Bellicum, including an Bellicum-Requested Change; or(y) the failure or delay on the part of any supplier of materials designated and required by Bellicum or any other Subcontractor designatedand required by Bellicum; or(z) a Required Change or other change in any material requirement relating to the development, manufacturing, packaging and shipping ofMiltenyi Product at Miltenyi’s facility required by Applicable Laws, or the imposition of any other condition with respect to the MiltenyiProduct by any governmental body or agency, or Regulatory Authority, based on Applicable Laws, or an event of Force Majeure, unlessMiltenyi fails to use [......] to remedy the failure, inability, or delay within a reasonable period of time. In the event of the foregoingfailures, inabilities, or delays, the Parties shall meet and discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.(ii)If Miltenyi fails to Deliver to Bellicum at least [......]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of anaccepted Purchase Order, then for that Miltenyi Product affected by such failed Delivery, the next step in theDiscount scheme set forth in Exhibit F shall be applied to such Miltenyi Product during the following two (2)Calendar Quarters (and a repeated failure shall result in further step in the Discount scheme being applied in likemanner).(3) In the event that Bellicum selects a Second-Source Supplier over Miltenyi’s reasonable objection, Miltenyi shall not be responsible toBellicum for the performance of the said Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall, as a condition of qualification,provide reasonable and customary undertakings to Miltenyi related to the protection of Miltenyi’s Confidential Information. Bellicum shallbe primarily responsible, with Miltenyi’s reasonable cooperation and assistance, for providing proof of product equivalence and for filingall submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seekapproval of a manufacturing facility as Second-Source Supplier for Affected Miltenyi Product. Further, Bellicum shall be primarilyresponsible, with Miltenyi’s reasonable assistance, for all process and equipment validation24Miltenyi Biotec-BellicumSupply Agreement(Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to passgovernment inspection by such Regulatory Authorities.(4) In the event of a Supply Failure, Miltenyi shall grant Bellicum’s Second-Source Supplier a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,one-site production license, without the right to sublicense, under Miltenyi’s Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent reasonablynecessary to manufacture the Affected Miltenyi Product for the Permitted Use by Bellicum at Bellicum’s cost. For the avoidance of doubt,a Second-Source Supplier’s license under this subsection shall not permit the manufacture of any Miltenyi Product that is not subject toSupply Failure.
