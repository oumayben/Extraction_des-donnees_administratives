In caseany such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, theindemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarlynotified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent ofthe indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party or any other indemnified party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to suchindemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under suchsubsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, inconnection with the defense thereof 26other than reasonable costs of investigation, unless (i) the indemnifying party and such indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to thecontrary, (ii) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party or (iii)the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party andrepresentation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. Noindemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entryof any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be soughthereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise orjudgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include astatement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifyingparty be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnifiedparties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same allegations orcircumstances.(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party undersubsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, other than dueto the express provisions thereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a resultof such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefitsreceived by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities to whichany such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately precedingsentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnifiedparty in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand andthe Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received bythe Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceedsfrom such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, asset forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. 27The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact orthe omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the RemarketingAgents on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement oromission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d)were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method ofallocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by anindemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shallbe deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending anysuch action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount inexcess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to thepublic exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or allegeduntrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the RemarketingAgents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities andnot joint.(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shallextend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act.
