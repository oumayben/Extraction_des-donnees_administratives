This Subparagraph 11.4 shall not operate to confer on a Party any financial orother benefit of substance to which that Party would not otherwise be entitled under this Agreement. 11.5 The Terminal Parties agree to grant a Terminal Station Right of Use to APCN 2 IRU purchasers. 11.6 In the event of a sale or other disposition of Segment T1, T2,T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9 and T10, or part thereof prior to the termination of thisAgreement, the owner shall share with the other Parties hereto any net proceeds, or costs, of such sale or disposition received, orexpended, by the owner, to the extent allocable to the Capital Costs, in the proportions set forth in Schedule B. 12. ACQUISITION AND USE OF CAPACITY 12.1 Capacity of APCN 2 can only be used by a carrier. 12.2 Parties shall obtain Allocated Capacity in the form of MIU on an ownership basis as shown in Schedule C, in return for their financialinvestment as identified in Schedule B. 12.3 Procedures for Parties activation of their Allocated Capacity will be developed by the ARRSC and the NA for Management Committeeapproval. 24 ASSIGNMENT OF CAPACITY 12.4 For each MIU of its Allocated Capacity, a Party is allowed to assign two (2) half STM-l circuits on any Path within the APCN 2. All suchcircuits are ring-protected. Additional ring-protected half STM-1 circuits may be granted proportionately to a Party’s Allocated Capacityas shown in Schedule C at the discretion of the Management Committee according to the recommendation of the ARRSC and the NA. 12.5 The Parties may designate a portion of their Allocated Capacity in specific Paths of the APCN 2 as: (i) Jointly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as “JAC”) which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-I circuits, with onehalf STM-1 circuit assigned to a Party, which together with the corresponding half STM-1 circuit, shall be used for the provisionof international telecommunications services between such a Party and another Carrier that has received the right of use pursuantto this Paragraph 12 or an APCN 2 IRU purchaser. Any alteration to the JAC is subject to bilateral agreement between bothCarriers. (ii) Wholly Assigned Circuit (hereinafter referred to as “WAC”) which shall be considered as consisting of two half STM-1 circuitsassigned to one Party. USE OF WHOLLY ASSIGNED CIRCUIT 12.6 A Party is allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with itself, its Subsidiary, its Parent Companyand/or the Subsidiary of the Party’s Parent Company provided that the correspondent parties are also Carriers. 12.7 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC to interconnect with other communication systems for the provision of internationaltelecommunications services terminating outside the APCN 2 landing Countries. If such WAC is originated from any APCN 2 landingCountry, such Party must be a Carrier of that Country. 12.8 A Party is also allowed to use its WAC for the provision of international telecommunications services with its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate ofthe Party’s Parent Company provided that this Affiliate is a Carrier and a cash contribution is made by the Party to a special funddedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the Equipped Capacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7. PORTABILITY OF CAPACITY 12.9 A Party is allowed to de-assign its JAC and/or WAC to its Allocated Capacity provided that bilateral agreement is given by the concernedCamera and according to the guidelines to be developed by the ARRSC and the NA. 12.10 Re-assignment of Allocated Capacity which resulted from the de-assignment of the JAC and/or WAC shall give priority to the assignment ofAllocated Capacity which has not 25 been de-assigned before, in the event that there is any conflicting requirement for use of capacity on the APCN 2. 12.11 Under no circumstances shall a Party’s JAC and/or WAC be de-activated due to the assignment of other Parties’ Allocated Capacity. TRANSFER OF CAPACITY 12.12 For the purpose of this Agreement, Transfer of capacity (hereinafter called “Transfer”) is the making available of all the right of use of thecapacity being made available that is accorded to a Party by this Agreement to a third party without transferring the Party’s otherobligations and rights including the right of Transfer. 12.13 Transfer of a Party’s Allocated Capacity to its Subsidiary or its Parent Company or the Subsidiary of the Party’s Parent Company is allowedprovided that the capacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier. 12.14 Transfer of a Party’s Allocated Capacity to its Affiliate and/or the Affiliate of the Party’s Parent Company is also allowed provided that thecapacity transferred is in multiples of the MIU and that the recipient of the transferred capacity is a Carrier. For the Transfer to an Affiliate,the transferring party shall make a cash contribution to a special fund dedicated solely to fund future upgrades to increase the EquippedCapacity. The amount of the contribution is described in Annex 7. 12.15 The conditions applicable to the use and Transfer of capacity as specified in Annex 7 shall be relaxed after the Equipped Capacity is expandedto four (4) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or two (2) years after the RFS date whichever comes first unless an earlier date is approved bythe Management Committee. Any relaxations on these conditions shall be approved by a vote of the members of the ManagementCommittee representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the total voting interests as specified in Schedule B. 12.16 The Unallocated Capacity in the APCN 2 shall be owned by the Parties in common and undivided shares in accordance with the percentagesin Schedule C. 12.17 IRU Capacity will be sold at the MJU level. Such IRU Capacity will be sold from the Unallocated Capacity. Proceeds from the sale of such IRUCapacity shall be used to fund the Expansion of the APCN 2 Equipped Capacity. 12.18 A Party or IRU purchaser may use its MIU with itself, another Party, or IRU purchaser to form matched circuits. 12.19 The distribution of capacity from the initial Unallocated Capacity shall be made no later than three (3) years from the RFS date on a pro ratabasis, in MIUs, in accordance with the percentages in Schedule C. The exact time to implement such distribution of capacity 26 shall be decided by a vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interestsas specified in Schedule B. 12.20 Once the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial Equipped Capacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comesfirst unless an earlier date is approved by the Management Committee, any Party is entitled to sell IRU to other Carriers from its AllocatedCapacity on a private basis without any restrictions except that the IRU shall be for the life of APCN 2. The terms and conditions includingpricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser. 12.21 When Unallocated Capacity is depleted, and during the period until the availability of additional Unallocated Capacity, a Party may be allowedto sell IRU to other Carriers from its Allocated Capacity privately subject to the Management Committee’s approval on a case by casebasis. The terms and conditions including pricing of such private IRU sales are bilateral matters between granting Party and purchaser. 12.22 Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Paragraph 12, when the Equipped Capacity is expanded to six (6) times of Initial EquippedCapacity or three (3) years after the RFS date whichever comes first, any Party is entitled to make available any of its Allocated Capacityfor use by other Carriers on any commercial basis without any restrictions. 12.23 Guidelines for use of the IRU Capacity and Terms and Conditions of the IRU agreement shall be developed by the IASC and approved by avote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total voting interests as specified inSchedule B. The NA shall be authorized to execute IRU agreements for one or more whole MIUs with APCN 2 IRU Capacity purchasers onbehalf of the Parties to this Agreement. No provisions of the IRU agreement shall override the provisions of this Agreement. 12.24 Schedules B, C, and D shall be modified by the NA, as appropriate, to reflect any revised ownership of capacity or sales of IRU Capacitypursuant to this Paragraph 12. 12.25 The Management Committee may authorize use of the Unallocated Capacity for restoration of telecommunications services and otherpurposes. The terms and conditions of such use shall be determined by the Management Committee based, in part, on terms to be agreedto by the relevant Terminal Parties of the APCN 2, in recognition of the technical and operational impact on the Terminal Stationoperations. Parties will receive revenues in accordance with Schedule C. 12.26 The communications capability of any capacity may be optimized by the Parties to whom such capacity is allocated by the use of equipmentwhich will more efficiently use such capacity provided that the use of such equipment does not cause an interruption of, or interference,impairment, or degradation to, the use of any other capacity in the APCN 2 or prevent the use of similar equipment by other Parties. AParty to whom capacity is allocated shall permit the use of such equipment by a Carrier to which such Party has 27 made available the use of any such capacity, provided that such Carrier agrees that its use of the equipment will satisfy the conditions setforth in this Subparagraph 12.26. 12.27 A Party may sell capacity in fascicles smaller than a STM-1 in the APCN 2 at any time on any basis other than by transfer of ownership. TheAPCN 2 shall not be responsible for aggregating such capacity to the STM-1 level. 13. EXPANSION OF EQUIPPED CAPACITY 13.1 Any upgrade of Equipped Capacity of APCN 2, including any costs, financial adjustments and allocation of capacity associated with suchupgrade, shall be approved by vote of members of the Management Committee representing at least two-thirds (66.67%) of the total votinginterests as specified in Schedule B. 13.2 All Parties shall have the might to a pro-rata share of the upgrade capacity in accordance with Schedule C.
