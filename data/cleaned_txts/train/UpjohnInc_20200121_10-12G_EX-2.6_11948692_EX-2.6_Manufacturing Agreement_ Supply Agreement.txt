On a Fiscal Year-by-Fiscal Year basis, Customer shall purchase each Product from Manufacturer at the Price for suchProduct for such Fiscal Year, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 3. The Price for each Product during the InitialPrice Term (such Price, the “Initial Price” for such Product) is set forth in the Facility Addendum for such Product. Following theInitial Price Term, the Price of such Product may be adjusted only as set forth in Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.2.(b)Price in Extension Periods. In the event that Customer elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement or of a Facility Addendum,the Price for each applicable Product in any Extension Period shall be one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer’s StandardProduct Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer’s Standard Conversion Cost of such Product, eachfor the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period with respect to such Product. During each Extension Period, the Price of suchProduct may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided that the initial Fiscal Year of the first Extension Period shall operate asthe Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below).-26-Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020(c)Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it is the intention of the Parties that the Price of each Productreflects one hundred percent (100%) of Manufacturer’s Standard Product Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent (110%) ofManufacturer’s Standard Conversion Cost of such Product. The Price for each Product will be set forth in the currency specified inthe applicable Facility Addendum.(d)Changes to the Standard Cost Methodology. Manufacturer shall have the right to change the Standard Cost methodology once perFiscal Year; provided that any change shall be consistent with the Accounting Method and applied across all products manufacturedat the applicable Facility. If Manufacturer elects to change the Standard Cost methodology, Manufacturer shall calculate both (i) therevised Standard Cost using the methodology effective during the then-current Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable FacilityAddendum and (ii) the percentage change in Standard Cost caused by the change in methodology relative to the formermethodology. If such Standard Cost methodology change results in an increase of Facility Conversion Cost for Productsmanufactured for Customer of more than two percent (2%), then Manufacturer shall revert to the former methodology for purposes ofthe calculation of Price during such Fiscal Year.3.2Price Adjustment.(a)Product Materials Adjustment.(i)On a Facility-by-Facility basis, with respect to each full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum, the Priceof each Product manufactured at the applicable Facility will be updated to reflect one hundred percent (100%) of the fullestimated amount of the increase or decrease in the cost of Product Materials for each such Product.(ii)In each Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report to Customer by no later than the end ofthe first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost with respect to each Facility for theprior Fiscal Year. In the event that the Facility Actual Product Materials Cost differs from the Facility Estimated ProductMaterials Cost, when adjusted to reflect actual volume, then Manufacturer shall issue either (A) an invoice to Customer forany amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer to Customerreflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and an adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year;-27-Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to theprovisions of Section 3.2(e). Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicableFacility Addendum within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of aninvoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer ofthe amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiverof any of Customer’s rights under this Agreement.(b)Conversion Cost Adjustments.(i)Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(b), on a Facility-by-Facility basis, if the Facility Conversion Costs of a Facilityduring any Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of the applicable Facility Addendum (such Fiscal Year, a“Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year”) are estimated to be (a) less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the FacilityConversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (as defined below) or (b) greater than one hundredand twenty-five percent (125%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year (clauses(a) and (b) referred to collectively as the “Facility Conversion Cost Threshold”), when adjusted to reflect a constant volumebetween the Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year and the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year, then thePrice for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year to reflect onehundred and ten percent (110%) of the increase or decrease in Facility Conversion Costs. An example calculation of theforegoing Price adjustment is attached hereto as Attachment G. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.1(b), the “FacilityConversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year” shall be, as of the Effective Date, 2019 budget volumes and costs as summarized in theapplicable Facility Addenda; provided that in each instance in which the Price is adjusted in accordance with the immediatelypreceding sentence of this Section 3.2(b)(i), the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year shall be the applicable FacilityConversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year.(ii)In the event that Price is adjusted as a result of a change to Facility Conversion Cost under Section 3.2(b)(i), the FacilityConversion Cost Threshold for all remaining Fiscal Years in the Initial Term (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will bereduced such that if Facility Conversion Costs of a Facility during any Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment Fiscal Year areestimated to be (a) less-28-Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020than eighty percent (80%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost Baseline Fiscal Year or (b) greaterthan one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of the Facility Conversion Costs for the Facility Conversion Cost BaselineFiscal Year, then the Price for such Product will be updated beginning with such Facility Conversion Cost Adjustment FiscalYear to reflect the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in Conversion Cost.(iii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), Manufacturer shall not have the ability to adjust the Price toreflect actual volume for Products in a Facility to the extent that Customer has reduced its demand for one or more Products insuch Facility due to Manufacturer’s breach of or other failure to supply under this Agreement or the applicable FacilityAddendum.(iv)In each Fiscal Year following the first full Fiscal Year of the Term of this Agreement, Manufacturer shall submit a report toCustomer by no later than the end of the first quarter of such Fiscal Year setting out the actual volume of Product for eachFacility for the prior Fiscal Year. In the event that the actual Facility Conversion Costs demonstrate that the then applicableFacility Conversion Cost Threshold has been exceeded, and Manufacturer had not previously adjusted the applicable Price inaccordance with this Section 3.2(b) to account for such adjustment, then Manufacturer shall either issue (A) an invoice toCustomer for any amounts owed by Customer to Manufacturer or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by Manufacturer toCustomer reflecting the difference between the Price as invoiced and the adjusted Price for such Fiscal Year; provided,however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions ofSection 3.2(b)(iii). For clarity, any amount owed by Customer to Manufacturer or owed by Manufacturer to Customer shall beone hundred and ten percent (110%) of Manufacturer’s Conversion Cost, reduced by a 20% allowance for variable costs.Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable Facility Addendum within sixty (60)calendar days from the date of the invoice. If Customer disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to payonly the amount not in dispute, and in such event Customer shall notify Manufacturer of the amount and nature of thedispute. Payment by Customer of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of Customer’s rightsunder this Agreement.(c)Notwithstanding the above, the price for Buy-Sell Materials will be updated annually in each year following the first Fiscal Year toreflect one hundred percent (100%) of the full estimated amount of the cost of Buy-Sell Materials to Manufacturer. Customer may notchange the price of Buy-Sell-29-Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/2020materials during any Fiscal Year. Upon any notification by Customer to Manufacturer of any reduction in the price of Buy-SellMaterials for the upcoming Fiscal Year, Manufacturer shall submit to Customer an inventory of such Buy-Sell Materials on hand anda calculation of the positive difference between the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the currentFiscal Year and the aggregate price for such Buy-Sell Materials applying the price for the upcoming Fiscal Year. Customer shallpromptly and in no event later than sixty (60) days issue to Manufacturer a credit memo in the amount of such positive differencereflected in Manufacturer’s notice.(d)The increases or decreases described in this Section 3.2 shall be determined by Manufacturer in a manner consistent with theaccounting methodologies used by Manufacturer as of the Effective Date and shall be based on the applicable Forecasts provided byCustomer in July of the applicable Fiscal Year and applied consistently across Manufacturer’s entire manufacturing operations for thefull Facility.(e)Manufacturer shall notify Customer of any estimated expected changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later than June 1of the then-current Fiscal Year and shall notify Customer of any actual changes to Prices for the upcoming Fiscal Year by no later thanOctober 30 of the then-current Fiscal Year.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party may not delay making anyindemnification payment required under the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise satisfying any indemnification obligation, pendingthe outcome of any Action to collect or recover Insurance Proceeds, and an Indemnitee need not attempt to collect any InsuranceProceeds prior to making a claim for indemnification or receiving any Indemnity Payment otherwise owed to it under this Agreementor any Ancillary Agreement.-63-Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, 1/21/202010.6Additional Matters.(a)Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 10shall be paid reasonably promptly (but in any event within sixty (60) days of the final determination of the amount that the Indemniteeis entitled to indemnification under this Section 10) by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upondemand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of suchindemnification payment, documentation with respect to calculations made and consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actuallyreduce the amount of such Liabilities.(b)If (i) a Party incurs any Liability arising out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; (ii) an adequate legal or equitable remedyis not available for any reason against the other Party to satisfy the Liability incurred by the incurring Party; and (iii) a legal orequitable remedy may be available to the other Party against a Third Party for such Liability, then the other Party shall use itscommercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the incurring Party, at the incurring Party’s expense, to permit the incurring Party toobtain the benefits of such legal or equitable remedy against the Third Party.(c)If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, suchIndemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances inrespect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant orplaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person.
