In the event that Qualigen elects not to prosecute or maintain in aparticular Applicable Market country any Patent Rights in the jointly developed Development IP (the “Abandoned Joint IP”), Sekisuimay elect to prosecute such Abandoned Joint IP in such particular Applicable Market country, in which case the Patent Rights forsuch Abandoned Joint IP in such particular in Applicable Market country shall be owned solely by Sekisui.12Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/20208.4.Marks. During and after the Term, neither Party shall register, use or claim ownership or other rights in any logo, trade name, brandname or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term (nor any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark confusinglysimilar to any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark of the other Party in existence during the Term), nor assist anyone else to doso, nor make or assist in any challenge to any logo, trade name, brand name or trademark of the other Party in existence during theTerm.9.Sale Transaction9.1.Exclusivity Period. The parties anticipate that they will entertain a potential acquisition of Qualigen by Sekisui during 2018 on terms tobe mutually agreed. Accordingly, Qualigen hereby agrees that during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall not, directly or indirectly,through its affiliates, agents, stockholders, officers, directors or otherwise solicit, initiate, participate in discussions or negotiations orotherwise cooperate in any way with, or provide any information to any person, entity or group other than Sekisui concerning a SaleTransaction. In the event that Qualigen nonetheless receives an unsolicited offer to engage in a Sale Transaction during suchExclusivity Period, Qualigen may engage with such party to the extent legally required to comply with its fiduciary duties, so long asQualigen (i) promptly communicates to Sekisui the material terms of any proposal or offer or request for information which it mayreceive in respect of any such proposed Sale Transaction, including the purchase price, form and timing of consideration and theidentity of the acquirer, and (ii) complies with Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal (as defined below).9.2.Negotiation Period. No later than July 1, 2018 (and sooner upon Sekisui’s written request at any time before July 1, 2018), the partiesshall engage in good faith negotiations for a period of up to 6 months (the “Negotiation Period”) with respect to a potentialacquisition by Sekisui of Qualigen. During the Negotiation Period, Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui all due diligence informationreasonably requested by Sekisui so that it may make an informed offer to acquire Qualigen. Any Financing Payments made by Sekisuiwill be credited against any such Sale Transaction agreed to between Sekisui and Qualigen. If the parties do not mutually agree to theterms of such potential acquisition within the Negotiation Period then the Exclusivity Period shall end and, subject to Sekisui’s Rightof First Refusal, Qualigen shall be free to negotiate the terms of a Sale Transaction with any Third Party.9.3.Right of First Refusal. During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fideproposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party (“Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal”). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 daysprior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence uponthe notification to Sekisui that Qualigen’s board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a termsheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 dayperiod, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amountof all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for 50,000,000 and Sekisui has fundedthe full 6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui’s Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have aperiod of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not beenconsummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3.13Source: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/20209.4.Penalty for Breach.

For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does notapply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholdersdid not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term.9.5.Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation withSekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic producttechnology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates.10.Representations and Warranties10.1.By Qualigen.

Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neitherParty shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other’s prior written consent. In all events,however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuseagreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonusepursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party(or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees)which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of theother except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights underthis Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after theTerm, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers ofProducts. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other’s Confidential Information as it wouldcustomarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard ofcare).
