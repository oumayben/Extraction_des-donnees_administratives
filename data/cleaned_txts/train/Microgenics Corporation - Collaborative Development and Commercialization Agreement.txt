The PHS Policy stipulates thatan applicant organization, whether domestic or foreign, bears responsibility for the humane care and use ofanimals in PHS-supported research activities. Also the PHS policy defines “animal” as “any live, vertebrateanimal used, or intended for use, in research, research training, experimentation, biological testing or for relatedpurposes.” This policy implements and supplements the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization andCare of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training, and requires that institutions use theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as a basis for developing and implementing an institutionalanimal care use program. This Policy does not affect applicable State or local laws or regulations that imposemore stringent standards for the care and use of laboratory animals. All institutions are required to comply, asapplicable, with the Animal Welfare Act, as amended and other Federal statutes and regulations relating toanimals. These documents are available from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes ofHealth, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.No PHYS supported work or research involving vertebrate animals will be conducted by an organization,unless that organization is operating in accordance with an approved Animal Welfare Assurance and providesverification that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has reviewed and approved theproposed activity in accordance with the PHS policy. Applications may be referred by the PHS back to theinstitution for further review in the case of an apparent or potential violations of the PHS policy. No award toan individual will be made unless that individual is affiliated with an assured organization that acceptsresponsibility for compliance with the PHS Policy. Foreign applicant organizations applying for PHS awards foractivities involving vertebrate animals are required to comply with PHS Policy or provide evidence thatacceptable standards for the humane care and use of animals will be met. Foreign applicant organizations arenot required to submit IACUC approval, but should provide information that is satisfactory to the Governmentto provide assurances for the humane care of such animals.H.21:Approval ofRequiredAssuranceby OLAWUnder governing regulations, federal funds which are administered by DHHS, Office of Biomedical AdvancedResearch and Development Authority (BARDA) shall not be expended by the contractor for researchinvolving live vertebrate animals, nor shall live vertebrate animals be involved in research activities byCompany under this award unless a satisfactory assurance of compliance with 7 U.S.C. 2316 and 9 CFRSections 2.25-2.28 is submitted within 30 days of the date of this award and approved by the Office ofLaboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW).
