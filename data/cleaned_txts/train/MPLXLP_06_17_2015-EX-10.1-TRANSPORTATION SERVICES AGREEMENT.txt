Effective Date and Term2.1This Agreement is effective June 11, 2015 (the “Effective Date”). The Agreement shall continue through the project’s in-service date andfor a period of fifteen (15) years after the project’s in-service date (“Initial Term”). MPL shall provide written notice to Shipper4confirming the project’s in-service date. Shipper acknowledges that the overall Project will be completed in several phases. New infrastructure will becompleted first, with additional build-out projects and expansions completed in succession. MPL will provide a thirty (30) day notice to Shipper,notifying it of the actual in-service date for the included projects.2.2This Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties under the same conditions and provisions for a time period commencing on theEffective Date and shall continue through the Initial Term. This Agreement will automatically renew for up to two (2) renewal terms offive (5) years each (each, an “Extension Period”) unless either Party provides the other Party with written notice of its intent to terminatethis Agreement at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Initial Term or the then current Extension Period. The Initial Term andExtension Period, if any, shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Term”.2.3In the event Shipper does not wish to renew after the Initial Term or Extension Period or chooses to terminate the Agreement by writtennotice pursuant to Section 2.2, MPL reserves the option and right to hold a subsequent open season in which interested shippers canhave opportunity to contract for resulting available volume, rate, and terms.3.Volume Commitment and Quarterly Deficiency Charges3.1Shipper guarantees that during each Contract Year, Shipper will meet its Quarterly Volume Commitment or, in the event it fails to do so,shall remit to MPL the Quarterly Deficiency Payment pursuant to Section 3.5. All volumes moved by Shipper on the Pipeline will besubject to the applicable Tariff Rates and proration policies, as may be amended from time to time in accordance with FERCmethodologies and as provided herein.3.2Shipper will have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for condensate, natural gasoline,and diluent service. These three Products are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of anyone or combination of these Products will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butaneservice, Shipper will also have the opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service,separate from condensate, natural gasoline, and diluent service.3.3Shipper shall be deemed to have shipped its Quarterly Volume Commitment on the Pipeline if the quantity of Product that Shipper shipson the Pipeline in any Quarter equals at least the Quarterly Volume Commitment for such Quarter.3.4Shipper agrees to pay MPL monthly: (a) the Tariff Rates in effect for all Shipper Deliveries transported by MPL on the Pipeline duringsuch month; and (b) any loading, handling, transfer and other charges incurred with respect to such Shipper Deliveries for such month inaccordance with the provisions as set forth in the Tariffs (or any other tariffs that may be applicable to such Shipper Deliveries). If theamount owed by Shipper is the subject of a good faith dispute, Shipper shall be obligated to pay only the undisputed portion of suchamount pending the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement. Late payments of undisputed amounts shall accrueinterest at a rate equal to two percent (2%) per annum, until paid. Such payments will be paid by Shipper to MPL within fifteen (15)Days of the invoice date or resolution of any dispute, if applicable.53.5Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement, if the volume of each Product shipped by Shipper on the Pipeline during theQuarter is less than the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product then, in addition to paying any amounts incurred byShipper pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to Shipper Deliveries for such Quarter, Shipper shall also pay MPL a deficiency payment(the “Quarterly Deficiency Payment”); equal to the product of:(a)the difference between the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitment for that Product for such Quarter and the volume of ShipperDeliveries of that Product on the Pipeline for such Quarter (the “Deficiency Volume”); and(b)the applicable Tariff Rate for that Product for such Quarter.Each Product to which the Shipper is obligated to move as part of its committed volumes will be added together for one total Quarterly DeficiencyPayment.Shipper’s transportation of commodities outside this Agreement’s definition of Product will not satisfy the obligation to move committed Product volume.All Product barrels moved by Shipper in excess of its Quarterly Volume Commitment will be attributed to Shipper’s movements on the Pipeline as aRegular Shipper, subject to the applicable Rules Regulations of the Tariff.3.6The dollar amount of any Quarterly Deficiency Payment paid by Shipper shall constitute prepayment for transportation of Product byShipper on the Pipeline and will posted as a credit (“Prepaid Transportation Credits”) to Shipper’s account for that type of Product. If,during any Quarter of the Contract Year, Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline exceed the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitmentrequirements, Shipper shall be permitted to apply Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amount due from Shipper and payable toMPL with respect to the transportation of volumes on the Pipeline for such Quarter. Any Prepaid Transportation Credits that are notused by Shipper during the four (4) Quarters immediately following the Quarter for which said Prepaid Transportation Credits wereposted to Shipper’s account (the “Credit Period”) will expire. Those Prepaid Transportation Credits that are in payment dispute inaccordance with Section 3.4, shall be posted as a credit on the date the payment dispute is resolved. If during any such four (4) Quarterperiod the nominated volume on the Pipeline for any month equals or exceeds the applicable portion in the Quarterly VolumeCommitment for the Pipeline for such month (the “Monthly Commitment”), but Shipper is prevented from shipping volumes in excess ofthe Monthly Commitment because of lack of available capacity, either because (a) the Pipeline is in allocation and Shipper is specificallysubject to allocation per Exhibit C, (b) the Pipeline is undergoing testing, maintenance or repair, or (c) a Force Majeure has occurredthat prevents MPL from transporting Shipper volumes on the Pipeline in excess of the Monthly Commitment, then the Credit Period shallbe extended by an equivalent time period for which Shipper has been prevented from shipping volumes in excess of the MonthlyCommitment. For the purposes of this Section 3.6, during the Term, if the Pipeline is in allocation for any portion of the month, thePipeline will be considered to be in allocation for the entirety of such month.3.7Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.5 to the contrary, upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason to the extentthat Shipper, at the time of such expiration or termination, holds any unused Prepaid Transportation Credits, Shipper shall be permittedto apply such Prepaid Transportation Credits against any amounts incurred by Shipper and6payable to MPL with respect to any Shipper deliveries on the Pipeline until the expiration of the applicable Credit Period with respect to such PrepaidTransportation Credits. This Section 3.7 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.3.8Shipper may not apply Prepaid Transportation Credits on differing types of Products; i.e, a Shipper may not use Prepaid TransportationCredits received for butane service on condensate, natural gasoline, or diluent service, or vice versa. Condensate, natural gasoline, anddiluent are interchangeable from a volume commitment standpoint and shipping a total volume of any one or combination of theseProducts will be applied towards the Quarterly Volume Commitment. Should MPL proceed with butane service, Shipper will also havethe opportunity to fulfill its Quarterly Volume Commitment on a calendar quarter basis for butane service, separate from condensate,natural gasoline, and diluent service.3.9If, following the binding open season and prior to the in-service date of the Tariff, MPL determines that it has available capacity notsubscribed to during the binding open season, not to exceed 90% of Project Capacity (“Unsubscribed Capacity”), to the extentpermitted by Governmental Authority; MPL will provide Shipper the right to increase its Quarterly Volume Commitment as submitted onits Capacity Request Form on Exhibit C. MPL will provide at least sixty (60) days’ advance written notice, simultaneously, to all shippers(including Shipper) who have executed a transportation service agreement during the binding open season of the availability and volumeof Unsubscribed Capacity for additional volume commitments (the “Additional Volume Commitments”). No later than thirty (30) daysfollowing the date of MPL’s written notice, Shipper must provide MPL with a written binding commitment identifying the additionalvolumes to be added to its Quarterly Volume Commitment (“Pre-Service Increase Request”). In the event MPL receives Pre-ServiceIncrease Requests that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the Unsubscribed Capacity, each shipper’s volume commitment shall beincreased by the volume of its Pre-Service Increase Request. In the event MPL receives Pre-Service Increase Requests that would, inaggregate, exceed the Unsubscribed Capacity, all Shippers will be allocated their Pre-Service Increases pro rata based on their then-current volume commitments. If Shipper makes a Pre-Service Increase Request, MPL shall notify Shipper of its new Quarterly VolumeCommitment within thirty (30) days following receipt of Shipper’s Pre-Service Increase Request, and Exhibit C shall be deemed revisedto reflect Shipper’s new volume commitment, which shall equal the sum of its original Capacity Request Form volume commitment andits Pre-Service Increase Request or its allocated portion thereof pursuant to this Section 3.9. If there is still Unsubscribed Capacity aftershippers (including Shipper) exercise Additional Volume Commitments as set forth above, MPL may conduct a second open season toobtain additional volume commitments for any remaining Unsubscribed Capacity.4.Transportation Charges4.1Shipper shall pay MPL a transportation charge for each Barrel of Product shipped under the terms of this Agreement and Exhibit C, atthe rates provided for in Exhibit B, which shall be the Tariff Rates for the volume commitment on the Day of delivery of Product.4.2The rates in Exhibit B will be adjusted annually in accordance with the standard FERC annual oil pipeline indexing methodology in effectat the time of the escalation. There shall be no downward adjustment of the Rates in the event the annual FERC oil pipeline index rate isnegative. Rates will typically be indexed during July of each year and would be first indexed in July of the year following projectcompletion.74.3If during the term of this Agreement, MPL becomes obligated as a result of a Change in Law Event to bear Compliance Costs, MPLshall have the right to increase the Tariff Rates on the Pipeline, including Shipper’s committed rate as originally executed on Exhibit B inthis Agreement or to impose a surcharge on its shippers (including Shipper) to recover such Compliance Costs. If MPL determines torecover any Compliance Costs from its shippers, it will do so in a manner that is reasonable and equitable to all shippers on the Pipeline.4.4A “Committed Priority Shipper” will receive transportation service exempt from prorationing provisions under normal operatingconditions for its contractually committed volumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to theterms of this Agreement executed during the open season process. The rates vary depending upon project options, but in all instanceswill be 0.01 per barrel above the rates for uncommitted service for the same origin and destination points. A Committed PriorityShipper will have the same rates as the Committed Non-Priority Shipper (as defined below), unless the system in under prorationing.When under prorationing, the Committed Priority Shipper’s rate will be charged the premium rate of 0.01 above the posteduncommitted rate. Shipper shall not be a Committed Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement. Shipper must submit a CapacityRequest Form during MPL’s binding open season (Exhibit C) which confirms the Shipper has elected Committed Priority Shipper Status.4.5A “Committed Non-Priority Shipper” will receive transportation service subject to prorationing provisions for its contractually committedvolumes, in exchange for a commitment to transport (or pay for) those volumes, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement executed duringthe open season process. Those who elect to become a Committed Non-Priority Shipper will receive the benefit of discounted rates thatwill not be available to the Committed Priority Shippers or the uncommitted shippers. The rates will vary depending upon project optionsand commitment duration. MPL will not presume Shipper to be a Committed Non-Priority Shipper solely through this Agreement, unlessthe Capacity Request Form submitted by Shipper during MPL’s binding open season (Exhibit C) shows the Shipper has electedCommitted Non-Priority Shipper Status.5. Force Majeure5.1As soon as possible upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the affected Party shall provide the other Party written notice of theoccurrence of such Force Majeure event (a “Force Majeure Notice”). A Party shall identify the full particulars and the approximatelength of time that the Party reasonably believes in good faith such Force Majeure event shall continue (the “Force Majeure Period”). If aParty advises in any Force Majeure Notice that it reasonably believes in good faith that the Force Majeure Period shall continue formore than twelve (12) consecutive months, then, subject to Section 10 below, at any time after a Party delivers such Force MajeureNotice, either Party may terminate this Agreement, but only upon delivery to the other Party of a notice (a “Termination Notice”) at leasttwelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the Force Majeure Period; provided, however, that such Termination Notice shall bedeemed canceled and of no effect if the Force Majeure Period ends prior to the expiration of such twelve (12) months period. For theavoidance of doubt, neither Party may exercise its right under this Section 5.1 to terminate this Agreement as a result of a Force Majeureevent with respect to any machinery, storage, tanks, lines of pipe or other equipment that has been unaffected by, or has been restored toworking order since, the applicable Force Majeure event.85.2Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Shipper delivers a Termination Notice to MPL and, within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice,MPL notifies Shipper that MPL reasonably believes in good faith that it shall be capable of fully performing under its obligations underthis Agreement within a reasonable period of time, then the Shipper Termination Notice shall be deemed revoked and the applicableportion of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such Shipper Termination Notice had never been given.5.3Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, MPL’s obligation to transport on the Pipeline may be temporarily suspended during occurrencesof, and for the entire duration of, a Force Majeure event that prevents MPL from transporting on the Pipeline. If MPL is unable totransport due to a Force Majeure event or otherwise, then Shipper’s obligation to ship the applicable Quarterly Volume Commitmentand pay the applicable Quarterly Deficiency Payment shall be reduced to the extent that MPL is prevented from shipping the fullapplicable Quarterly Volume Commitment. At such time as MPL is capable of transporting volumes equal to the full applicable QuarterlyVolume Commitment on the Pipeline, Shipper’s obligation to ship the full Quarterly Volume Commitment shall be restored.6. Capabilities of the Pipeline System6.1MPL shall use reasonable commercial efforts to minimize the disruption of service on the Pipeline and any portion thereof. MPL shallpromptly inform Shipper of any anticipated partial or complete disruption of service on the Pipeline, including relevant information aboutthe nature, extent, cause and expected duration of the disruption and the actions MPL is taking to resume full operations, provided thatMPL shall not have any liability for any failure to notify, or delay in notifying, Shipper of any such matters except to the extent Shipperhas been materially prejudiced or damaged by such failure or delay.6.2Subject to Force Majeure, disruptions for routine repair and maintenance consistent with pipeline industry standards and anyrequirements of Applicable Law, MPL shall accept for shipment on the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standard Product.Further, MPL shall maintain and repair all portions of the Pipeline in accordance with pipeline industry standards and in a manner whichallows the Pipeline to be capable, subject to Force Majeure or temporary shutdown for pipeline testing and maintenance, of shipping,storing and delivering volumes of Product.6.3If the Shipper has agreed to pay, pursuant to Exhibit B and Exhibit C, a premium rate for transportation of Product on the Pipeline, theShipper Deliveries shall not be reduced under normal operating conditions if the capacity for Product shipments is otherwise subject toprorationing in accordance with the prorationing provisions in MPL’s Rules and Regulations Tariff.6.4If, for any reason, including without limitation a Force Majeure event, the capacity of the Pipeline is reduced, then (a) during such periodof reduced capacity, Shipper’s obligation shall be reduced as described above in this Section 6; and (b) within a reasonable period oftime after commencement of such reduction, MPL shall make repairs to and/or replace the affected portion of the Pipeline to restorecapacity. MPL shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to provide transportation of Product tendered by Shipper under theTariffs while restoration is being completed. Any work performed by MPL pursuant to this Section 6.49shall be performed and completed in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with applicable pipeline industry standards and in accordance with allapplicable laws.6.5Expansion of Pipeline. MPL reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to expand the capacity of the Pipeline at any time or from time totime.6.6Right of Shipper to Secure Expansion Capacity. In the event that MPL decides in its sole discretion to expand the capacity of thePipeline, then:(a)MPL will provide each Shipper with notice of such proposed expansion not less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior tothe expected in-service date of such proposed expansion (“Expansion Notice”) and such Expansion Notice shall include:(i) the amount of the proposed expansion capacity;(ii) the expected rates and rules and regulations that will apply to such expansion capacity;(iii) the expected in-service date of such expansion/extension.The costs of any expansion shall not be rolled into the rates associated with any Pipeline capacity existing prior to such expansion.(b)To the extent permitted by Governmental Authorities, MPL will provide to each Shipper a first right, on terms and conditionsspecified by MPL that is consistent with this first right, to submit a binding nomination to ship, or otherwise pay for, a committedvolume of Product on the expansion capacity (“Requested Expansion Volume Commitment”). The amount of expansion capacityavailable for volume commitments pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total expansioncapacity. No later than sixty (60) days following the date of MPL’s Expansion Notice, Shipper must commit to, in a formacceptable to MPL in MPL’s sole discretion, its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment (“Election Deadline”). In the eventthat, pursuant to this first right, MPL receives binding commitments for volumes that exceed the expansion capacity available forcommitted volumes, each Shipper that submitted a binding commitment pursuant to this first right procedure shall be allocated thelesser of: (i) its Requested Expansion Volume Commitment, or (ii) the Shipper’s pro-rata share of the expansion capacityavailable for committed volumes, which shall be calculated by multiplying (1) the Shipper’s Proportionate Share, times (2) theexpansion capacity available for committed volumes (“Expansion Volume Commitment”). MPL shall notify Shipper of itsExpansion Volume Commitment within thirty (30) days following the Election Deadline, and the Parties shall promptly execute anew and separate transportation service agreement reflecting Shipper’s Expansion Volume Commitment. Any calculation of anExpansion Volume Commitment shall be without regard to and shall not affect any Volume Commitment on pre-existing capacity.(c)In the event that any expansion capacity available for committed volumes remains after the procedure set forth in Section 6.6 iscompleted, MPL has the right, in its sole discretion, to offer such committed capacity pursuant to an open season in which allinterested shippers will be given an opportunity to commit to transport a specified volume of Product on such remainingexpansion capacity, subject to the terms and conditions specified by MPL pursuant to or in connection with such open season.107 Confidentiality7.1From and after the Effective Date, each Party shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, managers,officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, contractors, and other representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) to hold allConfidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that applies to such Party’sconfidential and proprietary information and shall not use such Confidential Information except in connection with its performance oracceptance of services hereunder and shall not release or disclose such Confidential Information to any other Person, except itsRepresentatives.
