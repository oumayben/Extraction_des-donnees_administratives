This Affiliate Agreement represents an agreement between theundersigned and PSS regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersignedin connection with the shares of PSS to be received by the undersigned as aresult of the Merger. In consideration of the Merger and the mutual covenants contained herein,the undersigned and PSS hereby agree as follows: 1. Affiliate Status. The undersigned understands and agrees that as to ---------------- GSMS he is an "affiliate" under Rule 145(c) as defined in Rule 405 of the Rulesand Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under theSecurities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and the undersigned anticipatesthat he will be such an "affiliate" at the time of the Merger. 2. Initial Restriction on Disposition. The undersigned agrees that he ---------------------------------- will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interests in, or reduce hisrisk relative to, any of the shares of PSS Common Stock into which his shares ofGSMS Common Stock are converted upon consummation of the Merger until such timeas PSS notifies the undersigned that the requirements of SEC Accounting SeriesRelease Nos. 130 and 135 ("ASR 130 and 135") have been met. The undersignedunderstands that ASR 130 and 135 relate to publication of financial results ofpost-Merger combined operations of PSS and GSMS. PSS agrees that it will publishsuch results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the solediscretion of PSS, but in any event within 45 days after the end of the firstfiscal quarter of PSS containing the required period of post-Merger combinedoperations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following suchpublication. 3. Covenants and Warranties of Undersigned. The undersigned represents, --------------------------------------- warrants and agrees that: (a) The PSS Common Stock received by the undersigned as a result of the Merger will be taken for his own account and not for others, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part. (b) PSS has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the undersigned of PSS Common Stock has not been registered under the 1933 Act and that shares of PSS Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can only be sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the 1933 Act, or (2) in conformity with the volume and other requirements of Rule 145(d) promulgated by the SEC as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, or (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under the 1933 Act might be available. The undersigned understands that PSS is under no ------------------------------------------------ obligation to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the --------------------------------------------------------------------- disposition of the undersigneds shares of PSS Common ----------------------------------------------------- Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an ---------------------------------------------------------------------- exemption from such registration available. ------------------------------------------ (c) During the 30 days immediately preceding the Effective Time of the Merger, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of GSMS Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders Meeting of GSMS held to approve the Merger. (d) The undersigned is aware that PSS intends to treat the Merger as a tax- free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") for federal income tax purposes. The undersigned agrees to treat the transaction in the same manner as PSS for federal income tax purposes. The undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations requires "continuity of interest" in order for the Merger to be treated as tax-free under Section 368 of the Code. This requirement is satisfied if, taking into account those GSMS shareholders who receive cash in exchange for their stock, who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, or who dissent from the Merger, there is no plan or intention on the part of the GSMS shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of the PSS Common Stock to be received in the Merger that will reduce such shareholders ownership to a number of shares having, in the aggregate, a value at the time of the Merger of less than 50% of the total fair market value of the GSMS Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The undersigned has no prearrangement, plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an amount of his PSS Common Stock to be received in the Merger which would cause the foregoing requirement not to be satisfied. 4. Restrictions on Transfer. The undersigned understands and agrees that ------------------------ stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of PSS Common Stockreceived by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to PSSstransfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for suchshares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance: "The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a business combination which is accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and may not be sold, nor may the owner thereof reduce his risks relative thereto in any way, until such time as PSS, Inc.
