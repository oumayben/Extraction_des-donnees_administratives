(“Dova”)(DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseaseswhere there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (“Salix”), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in theworld committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health CompaniesInc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova’sDOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approvedDOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who arescheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in theUnited States for this indication.Thrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality inpatients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severethrombocytopenia (75,000/μL) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increasedrate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such asliver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.As part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promoteDOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain otherspecialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) ofDOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.“We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force inthe United States,” said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. “Given Salix’s presence andstrong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among thegastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.”“Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN (rifaximin),an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence ofchronic liver disease,” said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. “Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enableour sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.”CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed tomimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.Two global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N231] and ADAPT-2 [N204]), conducted in adultswith thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/μL) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned toeither 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to 50,000/μmL or40,000/μmL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients notrequiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials inboth the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p 0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs.23%, p 0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the twosecondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patientsachieving the target platelet count of 50,000/μmL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet countfrom baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for eachsecondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values 0.0001. The most common adverse reactions withavatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses havebeen reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal veinthrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.INDICATIONDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease whoare scheduled to undergo a procedure.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic andthromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients withchronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated withDOPTELET.Consider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors forthromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency orProtein C or S deficiency).DOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.CONTRAINDICATIONS: NoneCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizationsin adults.There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should beexercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.INDICATION XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence inadults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONXIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycinantimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C.difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcareprovider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may causeincreased effects of the medicine.Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine)because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were:HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue(feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen) IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymesXIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because thedose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN becauseXIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant.You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
