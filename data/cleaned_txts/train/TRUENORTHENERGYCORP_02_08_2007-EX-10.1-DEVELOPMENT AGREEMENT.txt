(B)If BP proposes to abandon the Initial Well as a dry hole, (i) BP shall plug and abandon the Initial Well in accordance withSection 2.6, and (ii) Company shall have no right or option to takeover the Initial Well.3.2 If BP does not drill the Initial Well to the Objective Zone, Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, for a period ofone (1) year from the date the drilling rig used to drill the Initial Well is removed from the well site location for the Initial Well (the “Rig ReleaseDate”), to participate in the drilling of a Substitute Well. BP shall have no obligation to drill a Substitute Well, and Company shall have no right topropose a Substitute Well. If and when BP elects to drill a Substitute Well, BP shall provide Company with an AFE for the Substitute Well. The AFEfor the Substitute Well shall include, at a minimum, the surface and bottomhole location of the Substitute Well, the Objective Zone, and theestimated costs for the Substitute Well as a dry hole and as a producer. Company shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such written notice toelect whether it shall participate in such Substitute Well. Failure to respond within the time period allowed shall be deemed to be an election not toparticipate in the Substitute Well.3.3 If BP proposes to drill a Substitute Well and Company timely elects to participate in such Substitute Well in accordance withSection 3.2, such Substitute Well shall be treated for all purposes herein as the Initial Well (including, but not limited to, Company’s obligation topay 11.67% of the Drilling Costs for such Substitute Well), except that the Objective Zone for such Substitute Well shall be governed by the AFEfor such Substitute Well.3.4 If Company elects not to participate in a Substitute Well, or is deemed not to participate in a Substitute Well, this Agreementshall terminate except as provided in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.
