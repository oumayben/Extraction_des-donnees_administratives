Seller shall provide toPurchaser, upon Purchaser’s reasonable request during the Review Period, information regarding such Patent Review List,the Patents listed thereon, and each such determination.

If the Invention Disclosure Review Team determines, during theReview Period, that a Shared Review Invention Disclosure should be or should have been, as applicable, Assigned Know-How, then, if such agreement was reached on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the parties shall add such Shared ReviewInvention Disclosure to Schedule 1.1(j) and, if such agreement was reached after the Initial Closing Date, Seller shall (andshall cause the other Seller Parties to) promptly execute a Contract containing a present grant of assignment (or, if and tothe extent, as a matter of Law in any jurisdiction, ownership, title, or any rights or interest in or to any such Shared ReviewInvention Disclosure cannot be so assigned, a license) of such Shared Review Invention Disclosure to the PurchaserAssignees, consistent with the terms and conditions of Section 2.1(b)(i) or Section 2.1(b)(ii), as applicable.(D) Newly Identified Business Employee.

If any of such Additional Patents are not reviewed, or the parties cannot agree on whether anyAdditional Patent should be or should have been, as applicable, an Assigned Patent, prior to the Initial Closing Date, thenthe parties shall escalate such dispute to successively more senior-levels of executives as set forth in Section 2.1(b)(iii)(B).If such senior-levels of executives cannot resolve the dispute with respect to any such Patents (the “OutstandingPatents”) by the Initial Closing Date, then either party may, within thirty (30) days after the Initial Closing Date, 17submit such Outstanding Patents for dispute resolution as follows.
