The parties acknowledge and agree that certain OEM Software("MIPS-Based Software") being used on the Mainframe Hardware containslimitations based upon the number of millions of instructions per second("MIPS") performed; other OEM Software ("CPU-Based Software") being used on theMainframe Hardware contains limitations based upon CPU group ratings. Theparties also acknowledge and agree that they have previously determined thenumber of MIPS available, for each party, in excess of the current combined MIPSusage, in connection with the MIPS-Based Software ("Projected MIPS"), and inconnection with the CPU-Based Software ("Overhead MIPS"), both as set forth onExhibit N.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, atany time after an upgrade to a MIPS-Based Software license is purchased, if thenon-Triggering Party exceeds its Projected MIPS during a respective year, suchnon-Triggering Party shall pay the Triggering Party an amount equal to the totalcost to the Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction,the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used by the non-Triggering Partythat exceeds its original Projected MIPS, and the denominator of which is thetotal number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuant to the MIPS-Based Softwareupgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPS permitted prior to the upgrade. (iii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the completeseparation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respectiveOverhead MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, the CPU-Based Software is required,under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allowusage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective OverheadMIPS ("CPU Triggering Party") shall bear the full cost and expense of upgradingthe CPU-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused theMIPS limitations to be exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any timeafter an upgrade to a CPU-Based Software license is purchased, if the otherparty ("non-CPU Triggering Party") exceeds its Overhead MIPS during a respectiveyear, such non-CPU Triggering Party shall pay the CPU Triggering Party an amountequal to the total cost to the CPU Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrademultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used bythe non-CPU Triggering Party that exceeds its original Overhead MIPS, and thedenominator of which is the total number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuantto the CPU-Based Software upgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPSpermitted prior to the upgrade. (iv) The rules related to OEM Software upgrade requirements describedin subsections (ii) and (iii) above shall apply in the same manner, before orafter the completion of the LPAR separation, with respect to Mainframe Hardwareupgrade requirements.
