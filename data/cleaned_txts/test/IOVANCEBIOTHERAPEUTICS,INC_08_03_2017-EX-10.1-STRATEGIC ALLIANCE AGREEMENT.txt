D. Anderson Cancer Center, witha place of business located at 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030 (“MD Anderson”), a member institution of The University of Texas System(“System”), as of the date set forth above (the “Effective Date”). MD Anderson and LBIO are hereinafter individually referred to as a “Party” andare collectively known as the “Parties”. WHEREAS, as a comprehensive cancer research, treatment, and educational center, MD Anderson undertakes research and experimental activitiesin a variety of disciplines; and WHEREAS, the Parties hereby wish to establish a collaboration (“Collaboration”) with respect to the performance of one or more research studiesto be conducted pursuant to this Agreement (each such study, a “Study”, and collectively the “Studies”, and the activities to be performed withrespect to the Studies collectively, the “Research”). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,LBIO and MD Anderson hereby agree to be legally bound as follows: 1. Governance. 1.1 Joint Steering Committee. The Parties will establish a joint steering committee (“JSC”) of equal representation, comprised of threemembers from each Party, with the members of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party canappoint and replace its members in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party. The Principal Investigators foreach Study (as defined hereinafter) shall attend each JSC meeting, except in the event of exigent circumstances that do not permit such attendance. 1.2 JSC Meetings. The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least onemeeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting), with the location alternating between a site aselected by LBIO and a site selected by MD Anderson. LBIO will choose the location of the first such in-person meeting. Subject to Section 1.4below, the JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote; provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at leasttwo members from each Party (including for this purpose any proxy member appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member ofthe JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead. 1 1.3 JSC Responsibilities. The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Collaboration. In order to achieve the objectives of theCollaboration, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Collaboration. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidanceregarding the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of the Studies. In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinatingresolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Collaboration as a whole. Additional members can be invited by the JSC on a case by casebasis should discussion of certain topics require so; provided, that such members will be subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use atleast as strict as those set forth in Section 5 below. 1.4 Dispute Resolution. Decisions regarding Study design, changes and/or additions to the initially-agreed Protocols must be unanimous,with each Party exercising one vote each, and in the absence of such unanimity the status quo shall be maintained. For all other matters before theJSC, a unanimous decision, with each Party exercising one vote, is required; provided, that, if unanimity cannot be achieved regarding such othermatters, then LBIO’s chief executive officer may make the decision on behalf of the JSC, provided that LBIO’s chief executive officer will first make agood faith effort to consult with a designated executive at MD Anderson to resolve such matter. 2. Performance of Studies. 2.1 Studies. (a) During the Term (as defined below), LBIO and MD Anderson may periodically agree to collaborate with respect to theperformance of one or more Studies. In connection with each Study, the Parties shall execute, as applicable, a Study-specific clinical trial agreementor a pre-clinical work order where a clinical trial is not being conducted (each, a “Study Order”). Study Orders shall be numbered sequentially and,when executed, appended to this Agreement and made a part hereof. The first three Study Orders, when completed, will be incorporated into thisAgreement as Exhibit I, Exhibit II, and Exhibit III, and the Studies that are the subject of such Study Orders are also referred to herein as the “InitialStudies”. Each Study Order shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including (i) a detailed Study-specificprotocol (“Protocol”) that will be developed jointly by the Parties working together in good faith and (ii) any Study-specific resources or support tobe provided by LBIO, including any financial consideration (“Collaboration Funding”, but excluding financial support associated with the InitialStudies to the extent addressed in Section 4 of this Agreement). Any revisions or amendments to a Study Order or Protocol shall be implemented, ifat all, solely in accordance with the terms of the relevant Study Order and shall be subject to the approval of the JSC. The Parties acknowledge andagree that MD Anderson will be the “sponsor” of the Initial Studies that are clinical studies, as defined at 21 C.F.R. §§ 50.3(f) and 312.3(b), and willbe the holder of the investigational new drug applications (INDs) submitted to the FDA (as defined hereinafter) for such Initial Studies. (b) In the event of any conflict of any terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shallgovern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect tothe particular Study Order and specific term.
