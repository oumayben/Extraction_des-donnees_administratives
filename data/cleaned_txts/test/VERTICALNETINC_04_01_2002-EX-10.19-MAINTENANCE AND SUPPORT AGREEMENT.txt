The adverse impact of a Severity 1 Problem on Converges business is severe and immediate, and requires an immediate solution. A "Severity Level 1" Problem may have one or more of the following characteristics, in each case without Converge being able to implement a reasonable workaround: - Data is corrupted or lost by the Supported Product, or the Supported Product returns incorrect results, and such corruption, loss or incorrect results have a material adverse impact on critical or central functionality of the Supported Product - Complete or severe lack of ability to use the critical or central functionality of the Supported Product - The Supported Product crashes repeatedly - Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is not operational or is severely degraded - Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product fails to run to completion2 A "Severity Level 2" Problem is one where critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable, or performance of critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is severely degraded, but in either such case Converge can implement a reasonable workaround but such workaround does not downgrade the Problem to Severity Level 3 or 4. Use of critical or central functionality of the Supported Product can continue in a restricted fashion through use of such workaround, but the user still experiences a significant degradation of performance of such functionality. A "Severity Level 2" Problem may have one or more of the characteristics of a "Severity Level 1" Problem, but critical or central functionality of - the Supported Product can continue to operate in a restricted fashion through use of such workaround.3 A "Severity Level 3" Problem causes minimal interruption to non-central or non-important functionality. The Problem has a minor impact or is inconvenient. A "Severity Level 3" Problem may have one or more of the following characteristics: - Performance of the Supported Product is degraded in a non-critical manner - Performance of the Supported Product is minimally impaired 21 4 A "Severity Level 4" Problem causes no loss of use of the Supported Product. The following would be "Severity Level 4" Problems: - Cosmetic problem with the Supported Product - Documentation error - Minor incorrect behavior of the Supported Product that does not impede its operation 22 Exhibit B Problem Response and Resolution EffortsSEVERITY RESPONSE TIME AND STATUS REPORTS RESOLUTION EFFORTS LEVEL 1 - "Initial Response" (defined - Continuous efforts (24x7) with below) within 30 minutes after best available resources to the Problem is reported to VNE provide a workaround, patch, if the Problem is reported fix or other solution for the during Support Hours.
