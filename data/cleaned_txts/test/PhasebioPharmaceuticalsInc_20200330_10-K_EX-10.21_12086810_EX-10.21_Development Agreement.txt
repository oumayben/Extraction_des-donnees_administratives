A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an“Indemnified Party”) will give prompt written notice (each, an “Indemnification Claim Notice”) to the other Party (the“Indemnifying Party”) upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought, or ifearlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by anIndemnified Party to give notice of a Claim of a Third Party as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the IndemnifyingParty of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actuallyprejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the Claim andthe nature and amount of the Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). The IndemnifiedParty will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses.12.2.2 Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Claim by givingwritten notice to the Indemnified Party within [] after the Indemnifying Party’s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Theassumption of the defense of a Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the IndemnifyingParty is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party ofany defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party’s claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Claim, theIndemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Partythat is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, theIndemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers)received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Claim, theIndemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such IndemnifiedParty in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such Claim.12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to (a)participate in, but not control, the defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however,that such engagement will be at the Indemnified Party’s own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specificallyauthorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, and (b) control its defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice forsuch purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and engagecounsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2.12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any Losses related solely to payment of money damages in connection with aClaim and that includes a complete and unconditionalSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020release of the Indemnified Party, will not result in the Indemnified Party admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or otherequitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which theIndemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the IndemnifyingParty will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss,on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connectionwith Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Claim in accordance with Section 12.2.2, theIndemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose ofsuch Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by theIndemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonablywithheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, theIndemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Claim without the priorwritten consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, theIndemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information andtestimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may bereasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to theIndemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevantto such Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information andexplanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all itsreasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.12.3 Insurance.12.3.1 Generally.
