BII acceptsthe Material with the knowledge that it is experimental. The Material may not be transferred or otherwise made available, in whole or inpart, by BII to any other individual, entity or institution other than any Affiliated Companies Confidential Treatment Requested 12 of BII without the prior written consent of XENCOR, which may be withheld by XENCOR for any reason. Such consent is hereby given forBII or its Affiliated Companies to transfer the Material for quality control testing performed by a third party on a blinded basis. For theavoidance of doubt, in the event of a transfer of Material to an Affiliated Company of BII or to any third party with the consent ofXENCOR, BII shall ensure that the respective Affiliated Company or third party shall use such Material solely to conduct the Project inaccordance with the Project Plan, this Agreement, or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Parties in writing and shall not transfer orotherwise make available, in whole or in part, the Material to any other individual, entity or institution.

In no event will it be a breach of thisAgreement by XENCOR if the Phase 1 clinical trial or other clinical trials of the Product are not completed or an agreement is not enteredinto with a Business Partner so long as XENCOR uses commercially reasonable efforts to do so. 2.8.3 Timelines and Information XENCOR shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial of the Product in a timely fashion andto search for the Business Partner. A summary of the preliminary plan for the Phase 1 clinical trial of the Product to be conducted byXENCOR is attached as Appendix 7, it being understood that timing of such clinical trial 13 may be delayed to the extent (i) caused primarily by BII’s failure to provide Product conforming to the Specifications; or (ii) by safetyissues relating to the Product; or (iii) by regulatory delays; or (iv) other causes outside the control of XENCOR. XENCOR shall promptly provide BII notice of the completion and a summary overview of the outcome/observations of the Phase 1 clinicaltrial regarding the Product and a summary overview of any negotiations with a possible Business Partner regarding the furtherdevelopment of the Product.

The testing laboratory’s results shall be in writing and shall be final andbinding save for manifest error on the face of its report. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing, the costs associated withsuch testing and review shall be borne by the Party against whom the testing laboratory result finally rules.
