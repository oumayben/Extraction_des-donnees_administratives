The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any admission or statement made by theIndemnified Party or any failure by such Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim. 12.3.2 Defense of Claim.

In any such proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counselshall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without theprior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. TheIndemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is beingmanaged and/or controlled by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatenedproceeding in which the Indemnified Party is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been soughthereunder by the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability on claimsthat are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the Litigation Condition is not met, then neither Party shall have the right to control the defense ofsuch Third Party Claim and the Parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each Party’s own expense;provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party may at any subsequent time during thependency of the relevant Third Party Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defenseof the relevant Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the IndemnifiedParty in relation to the defense of such Third Party Claim from 36 the inception of the Third Party Claim until the date the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense or control thereof. 12.4 Assumption of Defense.
